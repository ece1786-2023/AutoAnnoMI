The following is a snippet from an MI conversation.  Return "simple", "complex" or "none" based on whether the therapist's utterance  has a simple, complex or no reflection.

Return one word which is the correct label.

Here are a few examples.

Examples:

Example 1
Client: That's a good way to sum it up. And it's-- Well, you understand it, uh, it's just- it's not good.
Therapist: Mm. So, and then you said, you don't like how it makes you act, um, if you can tell me a little bit about that.
Answer: simple

Example 2
Client: Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know.
Therapist: But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?
Answer: complex

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.
