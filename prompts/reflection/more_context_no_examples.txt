The following is a snippet from a motivational interviewing conversation. The snippet can have multiple therapist and client utterances. Return "simple", "complex" or "none" based on whether the last therapist's utterance  has a simple, complex or no reflection.  Feel free to return none as the therapist utterance might not have any reflection. Now, look at this snippet and output one word, which is the correct label for the LAST therapist utterance.
