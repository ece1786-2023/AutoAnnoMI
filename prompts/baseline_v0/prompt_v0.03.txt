Requirement: Analyze 2 conversation utterances and categorize the presence of a "reflection" statement in the "Therapist" utterance. Output "simple reflection" if a simple reflection is detected, "complex reflection" for a complex reflection, or "False" if no reflection is found. 
Context: Input is 2 utterances from a therapist-client conversation. A "reflection" involves repeating or rephrasing client statements, with sub-classification into Simple (RES) or Complex (REC). Simple reflections convey understanding without adding substantial meaning, while complex reflections deepen or expand on the client's statement.
