### instruction ###
given an utterance as input, classify if it contains a "reflection" statement in 3 outputs. For first output, explain why you think the utterance contains or does not contain a reflection and if it does, label the reflection as "simple" or "complex" and explain why. For second output, if the utterance contains a reflection insert "reflection_exists=True" , else insert "reflection_exists=False". For third output, if the utterance contains a "simple" reflection insert "reflection_subtype=simple", else if the utterance contains a "complex" reflection insert "reflection_subtype=complex", else insert "reflection_subtype=nan".

### Context ###
Given to you as input is a single utterance from a conversation between a therapist and client. Here are some explanations for the terminologies used in the instruction section:

Reflection: 
A reflection is a reflective listening statement made by the counselor in response to a client statement.
It can reflect client utterances from the current or previous sessions.
Reflections capture and return to the client something that the client has said.
Reflections can simply repeat or rephrase what the client has said or may introduce new meaning or
material.
Reflections can summarize part or all of a session.
Information that was provided by the client in a questionnaire or on an intake form can be coded as Reflect as long as it does not give the client new information.
Reflections require sub classification as either Simple (RES) or, Complex (REC) When a coder cannot distinguish between a Simple and Complex Reflection, the Simple Reflection is
the default category.

Simple Reflection:
Simple Reflections add little or no meaning or emphasis to what the client has said.
Simple reflections merely convey understanding or facilitate client/counselor exchanges.
Simply repeating or rephrasing what the client has said qualifies as a Simple Reflection.
They may identify very important or intense client emotions but do not go far beyond the original overt content of the client’s statement.

Complex Reflections:
Complex Reflections typically add substantial meaning or emphasis to what the client has said.
They convey a deeper or richer picture of the client’s statement.
They contain significantly more or different content from what the client actually said.
The counselor may add subtle or obvious content or meaning to the client’s words.
The following are almost always Complex Reflections
Analogy, metaphor and simile (not stated by the client) Exaggeration or amplification by understating or overstating
“Continuing the paragraph” by anticipation of what the client might reasonably say next.
Double-sided reflection containing both sides of ambivalence in a single Reflect.
Summaries are usually coded as Complex Reflections when they add content or meaning to client statements.
