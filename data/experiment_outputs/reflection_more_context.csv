Examples:

Example 1
Client: But-but the wheezing is something that I've definitely noticed a little bit.
Therapist: I guess I also wonder whether, regardless of-of if your asthma symptoms are connected to Oscar, that may be part of you feels like it's worth it because he's been-

Therapist: -such a big part of your life for so long.
Answer: complex

Example 2
Client: Um, I'm just- yeah I just like to have a few drinks. I mean, you know, obviously, I-I have, uh, this diagnosed condition, and-and I think, you know, if I were able to, you know, maybe take a few hits off of the joint and have a couple of beers, I think that's about the same as taking the medicine.
Therapist: Well, you know, what, I-- There are a lot of people that wouldn't disagree with you on that exactly. You know, so, um, uh, but I know that they-they were never quite sure how they were all interacting all together. Like the, um- the weed kind of tends to make people a little paranoid anyway.
Client: Yeah, I-I-I got to be careful with it. If I take more than a hit or two of it, it-it-it can be a bit of a problem.
Therapist: Yeah. Why, what happens if you take a little too much of it?
Answer: none

Example 3
Client: That's a good way to sum it up. And it's-- Well, you understand it, uh, it's just- it's not good.
Therapist: Mm. So, and then you said, you don't like how it makes you act, um, if you can tell me a little bit about that.
Answer: simple

Example 4
Client: Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know.
Therapist: But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?
Answer: complex

Example 5
Client: I wanna stay friends with them. I don't want- I don't want them to just-
Therapist: You don't wanna lose your support group, yeah. You just wanna them to support you in being healthy, while helping them, raising the babe, and so we're just taking path B. You don't wanna lose them, just maybe the lifestyle it sounds like.
Answer: none

Example 6
Client: Um, I mean, I guess- I guess I need some strategies for figuring out how to ease stress without, I guess, getting high.
Therapist: Okay. And that's a very good reason for being here. Um, can you talk to me about maybe some of your-- the goals that you have?
Answer: none

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: Hi. Are you Julie Thompson?
Client: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Therapist: Hi, I'm Bruce Berger. I work in the clinic and, uh, I noticed that you're in to pick up a prescription for Sarah's, uh, rescue inhaler-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: -for her asthma. I noticed that she's been in the emergency room five times in the last year for her asthma. What's that- what's that been like for you?
Client: It's been- it's been really difficult. Um, I hate to see her gasping for breath. And, um, I'm really worried, you know, when she has to go. Uh, so that's been-- it's really difficult when I have to take her.
Therapist: Yeah, it sounds like you'd be willing to do whatever you can to try to prevent that from happening.
Client: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. I-I also noticed that, uh, it's been about three months or so since you picked up the prescription for her chronic inhaler.
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: Are you having some difficulties with that?
Client: Well, I did research on the chronic inhaler and I found out that there were steroids in it and that-that I don't want her taking steroids. I did, uh, research on some of the potential side effects and some of the health problems that can result from taking steroids and I-I just don't want her to take those at all. I don't want her exposed to them at all. And then, uh, let me just go ahead and lay this out right now. Uh, because I'm sure it'll come up, but I-I do smoke. But I make sure that I do not smoke around her so that I make sure that it does not affect her. So-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -I just want to let you know that right off.
Therapist: Well, it sounds like you care about Sarah a great deal. You-you don't want her, uh, using steroids. You're worried about what kind of effects those would have on her and you're- you're working hard to keep your smoking away from her so it doesn't affect her asthma.
Client: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. Uh, would you mind if we talked a little bit about the chronic inhaler and the medicine that you're concerned about with, you know, the steroids because, you know, I certainly don't want her using a medicine that has steroids in it, like the ones that you're worried about for athletes. Uh, can we talk about that just a little bit?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. Even though, uh, even though this medicine isn't the-the medicine that's in this is in the same broad family as the steroids you're worried about, and those are called anabolic steroids.
Client: Okay.
Therapist: Which build people up and have masculinizing effects.
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: If-if I can draw an analogy-- Again, even though this medicine is in the same family as those big broad-broad family. If I could draw an analogy, a grape and a watermelon are in the same family of fruits, you know, and obviously, grape is much smaller than a watermelon. And if you eat one grape, you'd be fine. If you ate an entire watermelon, it can make you very sick. If we look at the grape as the medicine your daughter's taking, again, it's in the same broad family, the amount of drug that your daughter is getting is very small. Uh, and not only that it's not an anabolic steroid, even though it's in the same big family. And what this drug does is actually reduces the inflammation in your daughter's lungs. And-and it doesn't even get absorbed into the body. It only goes to her lungs. And as I said, I wouldn't want your daughter taking a medication that could have the impact of those anabolic steroids. This is really safe for your daughter to use. So what-what are your thoughts about considering having her using this?
Client: Well, I-I guess I didn't realize that they weren't the same thing as the anabolic steroids.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: Which are the ones that cause all the problems and everything. So, um, if-if you can assure me that it's not going to have those same side effects and health problems-
Therapist: Yeah, def-definitely would not. I mean, probably you saw the name corticosteroid and thought, ""uh-oh.""
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: You know. And so-- yeah, and that- and that does concern people. But I do want to reassure you that this is medication that only goes to her lungs, and won't get in her body and they're not the same kind of drugs as the ones you're worried about.
Client: Okay.
Therapist: Do you mind if I talk to you a little bit about what your daughter's lungs are like when she's having these inflammations and needing to go to the emergency room?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. When-when somebody has asthma, their lungs are like hypersensitive. If I could use an analogy, again, if-if you had the skin burnt off your arm, if somebody brushed up against you before he had the skin burned off your arm, it wouldn't bother you at all. But when the skin's burned off your arm, you literally react to it. Her lungs are exquisitely sensitive. Uh, and like the skin on your arm would be if the skin got burned off. And what this drug can do? This chronic inhaler is reduce the inflammation in her lungs so that her lungs don't remain exquisitely sensitive. Because otherwise, everything in the air like dust, pollen, uh, reacts with her, uh, in ways that it would not normally affect us.

Therapist: Okay, certainly glad to hear that your doctor did spend some time with you, um, I-I see myself as somebody who works with your doctor, uh, to help you get the most benefit from your medicine, uh, because you are gonna spend money on it we wanna make sure that you get the most benefit from it.

Client: Thank you.
Therapist: I'd say my name is Mark and I work here at Green Prescriptions. And-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: I know a little bit about you from the referral letter from the doctor.
Client: From my GP?
Therapist: From your GP, yeah.
Client: Uh.
Therapist: But before we get to anything, I'll probably want to just ask you a little bit about what's led you to come here today and get a bit of an idea about what's been going on for you.
Client: What's led me to come here?
Therapist: Mm.
Client: My GP.
Therapist: And what did he have to say?
Client: Well, um, you know, I had my sort of, uh, checkup.
Therapist: mm.
Client: And it revealed that apparently, I might have diabetes 2. Well, that's what he says.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Um, I-I think that I feel perfectly well. I-I'm, you know-- I understand people with diabetes are a little bit plumper than I am.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: But, um, that's really why I'm here. I'm on his command, almost.
Therapist: Right, so he kinda gave you a directive?
Client: Well, he did. He says he's going to put me on some sort of program if it gets worse.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: But as I say, I-I feel absolutely fine now.
Therapist: So it kind of came a bit of a surprise, you feeling okay.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: You go for this checkup with the doctor. And he says, ""You've got Type II diabetes.""
Client: Mm, I'm very surprised.
Therapist: Mm. Came out of the blue for you?
Client: Yes. I think it did.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: And you said you kind of don't fit that kinda Type II diabetes look. That you kinda have had this idea-
Client: I-
Therapist: -you've been-been overweight with it.
Client: That's what I understand.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: You know, and I'm not overweight.
Therapist: Mm.

Therapist: Mm.
Client: I don't know, really.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: My lifestyle—
Therapist: Hmm. So it doesn't quite fit in your head, Type II diabetes and-
Client: No.
Therapist: -your lifestyle?
Client: No, not at all.
Therapist: Comes as a big surprise. And what was your reaction when he told you that at the time?
Client: Well, I-I thought he must be joking. To be honest. I thought-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -you know, why you are-- Look around you.
Therapist: Mm, mm.
Client: um, I just felt that, um-- I mean, I don't think he was wasting my time because why would he do that?
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: Right?
Therapist: He's got a lot to do.
Client: Um-- Absolutely right.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: He's got a job to do. And obviously, the tests have come through. And I have got these signs of diabetes 2.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Right? Um, I just think that-- Well, I just don't feel like it, Mark.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Um—
Therapist: So how are you feel in your head-
Client: I feel absolutely fine.

Therapist: Hmm.
Client: - I'm-I'm compos mentis. So I don't—
Therapist: Yeah. What's the problem? Mm.
Client: What is the problem?
Therapist: And how did this happen is probably kind of what you're also thinking. Well, how did this--?
Client: Well, uh, yes. I mean-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -I must admit, I haven't done too much research. I've been a bit busy.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Um, but he-he was saying something about, I don't know, family or whatever. I don't know.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And I don't know if it's hereditary.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I think he said something about it being hereditary.
Therapist: So he mentioned, it might be a family thing. And so you-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -maybe got from your parents or something of the sort.
Client: Yeah, it could be-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -because, um, my mother mentioned-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -that, uh, my father had diabetes-
Therapist: Right.
Client: -diabetes 2. And if I think about it, um, his brother-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -uh, I haven't seen him for years.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But he might well have it because he is-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -a pretty cuddly guy. You know-
Therapist: Right.
Client: He's pretty big.
Therapist: So he fits the picture-
Client: Well, yes, the stereotype,-
Therapist: -when you think about what he-he-- Yeah, he's stereotypical.
Client: Yeah, I guess.
Therapist: A little bit bigger, perhaps doesn't look after himself that well, and he fits that foot
Client: Well, yeah. I mean, as far as I know, I hadn't seen him for-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -I don't know how many years.
Therapist: Mm. So you got this knowledge as a witness there's some family history of diabetes in the past?
Client: Apparently so. Yes, apparently so.
Therapist: Doctor mentioned that as being a factor.
Client: Mm, I mean, it is hereditary, is it?
Therapist: That's certainly true. Yes. We know that people who've had parents or have been in the past, there is a hereditary factor or genetic factor in-involved.
Client: A genetic factor. And so, does that mean that if you've got, um, if you've got a history of this within your family-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -if it's a gene-- you are more likely than not to get it?
Therapist: Correct. Yeah.
Client: Also, it's—
Therapist: But it's not inevitable.
Client: Right. Okay.
Therapist: Because its genes or the-the-the-the hereditary factor is not the only factor that causes it or is involved in it happening to you. So there's other factors that come into play.
Client: I'm sure you're going to tell me what they are.
Therapist: Well, you've-you've mentioned some of the things you know, and one of those is hereditary factors. You mentioned that the doctor mentioned that. And what else do you know or have you heard? You say you haven't had a lot of time to do the research. What else? Other things you've.
Client: To be frank, Mark, I honestly don't know. I mean, I honestly don't know what causes it because I've never had any reason. It came upon me from the GP and it took me back.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, the hereditary thing I thought, well, maybe that's the explanation.
Therapist: That makes a bit of sense.
Client: And why go any further, it's there?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Can't help it.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: They live pretty long lives, they did, all right.
Therapist: They managed with it.
Client: Relatives relatively went into their 70s.
Therapist: Okay. I don't know if it'd be helpful for you if you'd like to know a little bit more about some of the factors involved in time Type II diabetes.
Client: Well.
Therapist: If that would help.
Client: If there's something that you think that-- Yes. Yes, of course.
Therapist: Well, I'll perhaps share with you what I know from working with other people and some of the things I've experienced in working with people.
Client: Okay.
Therapist: And see what you make of it. See if it fits a little bit more with where you're at. We know that there is a strong family factor or hereditary factor, so that's one aspect. So also it tends to happen a little bit later in life, rather than something you might get when you're a teenager, this type of diabetes. So-so it's a later onset. It takes a bit of time for it to develop maybe. And the main reason I think, um, the main aspect of it is that it, have you heard about insulin.
Client: I've heard of it yeah.
Therapist: So that's a hormone or a chemical, it allows you to utilize sugar in your body.
Client: Right.
Therapist: All right. And Type II diabetes typically people have a resistance or a resistance to insulin in their cells, in their fat cells or their muscle cells or liver cells. They can't use insulin. And so sugar builds up in your system.
Client: Are you saying that they-they like they can't digest insulin or is that?
Therapist: You need insulin in your cells, individual cells in muscle or in fat or wherever to, um, use up excess sugar or to utilize sugar.
Client: Oh, I see. So-so it's like a-it's like a balance.
Therapist: That's right.
Client: So insulin you-you.
Therapist: Kind of, as your.
Client: You have yourself draws bar.
Therapist: Yap.
Client: Or something, and then what balances that out in the body is the insulin taking off the excess.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Or-or digesting? Should I say the excessive sugars?
Therapist: That's a good way to think.
Client: Is that what happened?
Therapist: Exactly. And what's happening in Type II diabetes is your-your fat cells and liver cells and muscle cells are resistant to insulin. It's almost like they're saying we can't use that.
Client: Why?
Therapist: And if-- Well, there's a number of-- We're not entirely sure, there's a lot of research still going on as to how this happens and how that could be modified. But what we do know is that, um, one of the key things in managing it is to try and modify or modulate, control the amount of sugar that are in your system.
Client: Right. Okay.
Therapist: Yeah. So there's a couple of things that we know that people with Type II diabetes have to look after and have to think about if they want to control the amount of sugar that's in their system, which is the main issue that's causing some of the health problems that people have with Type II diabetes. Too much sugar, and if it's not able to be utilized in the blood cell, in the fat cells, or liver cells, and the muscle cells stays in your bloodstream. And that can cause problems with your circulation. So too high blood sugar and too low a blood sugar can be a problem. So sugar is the main concern in Type II- Type II diabetes.And you mentioned earlier on, a couple of things that the doctor-- You've mentioned some signs that he was kind of a little bit concerned about. Well, what things did you notice over the-over the last month or so?
Client: You mean, personally?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Well, I didn't know. I mean, the thing is you see that-- I mean, I did think about this a little bit and I thought, well, over time, if things happen slowly, you don't really notice.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: As you get older.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I don't-I don't leap over five bar gates like I used to, you know, um, as opposed to, uh, running with the backs now, I tend to spend more time, you know, with my old mates in the bar.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: At the rugby club and-and-and the such like, yeah. And, um, the fish I'm hooking, I'm not after the kings anymore, I go for the snapper now, it's a bit easier, you know.
Therapist: A slightly more sedate lifestyle.
Client: Yeah, absolutely. You just do.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: You just do. Um, so you're less demanding, I guess, on your-on your body, you realize, and you don't really want to do these things anyway. You know, you let the youngsters get home.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Been there, done that. So you don't really notice. So I'm coming back to this diagnosis I had from my GP and him saying, ""You've got diabetes 2,"" well, I should feel like that, shouldn't I?
Therapist: Yeah. It should feel like there's something really wrong with you.
Client: Yeah, I mean.
Therapist: What's-how have you been feeling over the last month? So, you say you're very busy you're doing a lot of work.
Client: Yeah, I mean I'm a busy person. All right? I uh, my work uh, I work in insurance, so I'm always hopping from one place to another place.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, I haven't noticed.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: I really haven't noticed how, um, okay I get a bit--I suppose I get a bit out of breath sometimes.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: If I rush too much that-that's true. Um, I suppose, um, I don't go upstairs two at a time anymore, I use one at a time.
Therapist: So a little bit sort of energy is not quite there sometimes? The vitality.
Client: Oh, certainly the energy I have is-is not what I-what I had. I mean I do need to, you know, I'm busy but I do need to sit down, um, uh, I do need to sit down and relax with a cup of coffee, you know, and, uh, things.
Therapist: Yeah, Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, more than I would normally.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But that would be, that would be about it.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, is it getting worse? I don't know. I-I-I suppose. What worse? Is it-is it increasing? Well, to say, I don't really notice it.
Therapist: You haven't noticed it. So it's a progressive, you know, you've just seen this, as-as you got older, things have slowed down. You know those activities you used to do, but that's kind of like what happens.
Client: Yeah, yeah. Um, at least, that's what I think. I mean I don't know if you're telling me that I should be more active or my GP is saying I should be more active.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, as I say, uh, you know I-I don't do any regular form of exercise, I have to say, not anymore.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: But maybe I-maybe I don't know.
Therapist: Hmm, a bit of a mystery there.
Client: I mean I've got uh, well I-I mean I've got a great lifestyle. I mean if it's very-it-it's very good. I mean I've got all my mates in down at the rugby club. And I've got uh, you know even in the summer when that's a bit damn. I used to coach rugby and I coached cricket when I finished playing. So-so I've got the-the guys in the cricket club, um, you know, for the-for the, uh, for the summer evenings. And, uh, and then, uh, the-then, of course, we've got the fishing, and that's all of us combined. We're a big gang, really.
Therapist: Really? So what I'm hearing is there's actually a lot of aspects in your life which are really good.
Client: Oh, I think my life yeah. My life is great.
Therapist: From your perspective, things are going well?
Client: My life is great, and then you turn around and say, ""Hey you've got-- you-you're ill, you're sick.
Therapist: Yeah. It doesn't fit.
Client: And um, no I'm not. But you see, he said to me that he's gonna put me on some sort of, uh, a daily monitoring of, is it sugar levels?
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: And I'm gonna have to take regular pills.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Well frankly, the only pills I take are sort of paracetamols.
Therapist: Yeah. When you get uh, a headache.
Client: For a bit of the head in the morning, you know.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um.
Therapist: So the idea of having to test-test your blood sugar and take medications is kinda like off--
Client: Come on, you know.
Therapist: And you know that's a bit too-
Client: Well, life is too short.
Therapist: Too much.
Client: You know it's the truth.
Therapist: Yeah. Okay.
Client: I mean you know—
Therapist: And you're here today and that's probably something in you you've thought well I'll follow this through, you know I'll-I'll come along and see what-see what they've got to say. And I'm just wondering for this session, for the time we have today, there's a number of things we could talk about. You mentioned a couple of things about your lifestyle and, um, medication is one thing you've been told by the doctor you might need to do that. And a number of things that we could talk about today. Which-which area would you think would be useful for you to focus on?
Client: Well there is-there is something that you sort of prompted me to think about, and, um, I split up-- My wife and I, we split up several years ago now. And, um, you know we've been married for many many years.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: And um, I think she used to look after me because she used to do the cooking and-and-and stuff like that.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And I have to say that I'm not the best cook in the world.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, and-and being on the run all the time and you know once I get back home, it's, you know, it's time to go down to the rugby club or whatever it might be, uh, we're out with the mates. And, uh, I-I do I suppose my food is not as healthy perhaps as it used to be when she was around. She's moved down to Hamilton to live with her mother, if you've met her mother. Anyway, but, um.
Therapist: So then, since you've been on your own since you've separated, divorced and you've noticed that the things you eat and how you eat has changed.
Client: Yeah, I mean mates and their wives are pretty cool about it sometimes.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Because, you know, they'll invite me for dinner and so on.
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: And, yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess, you know, that's when you, well, or whatever reason, you split up in life.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You start looking at the home life of somebody else, you're thinking, ""Hmm, I use d to have this.""
Therapist: Hmm. Yeah, yeah.
Client: And you think, "" This is nice food, "" isn't it? and you know.
Therapist: Yeah. And your-- part of your wife used to do a lot of that for you?
Client: Oh, she would do all the cooking. Yeah, yeah,
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I never bothered to boil an egg in the water, you know.
Therapist: And so she would kinda look after what you ate and healthy things that you had, spread in front of you and off you go.
Client: Totally. I mean, I was just in charge of the wine, you know.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. And now you have to think about what you might eat and sometimes you don't eat the best.
Client: Well I-- This is what I'm saying. Maybe I'm not thinking about it. Maybe that's the thing.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Maybe I'm just—
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You know, because it-- you know this-- the pizza shop's just on the road.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And then there's-- I mean, okay, I confess that lunchtime, occasionally, it's uh, I'm hungry and McDonald's is very convenient
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -or Kentucky Fried or whatever.
Therapist: Very appealing, isn't it?
Client: You know, it's very easy. and then, um, then you think to yourself, well-- I mean, I do think of myself that maybe I should have a few vegetables around here or whatever. But then you go out into the supermarkets, you know, and you can pick up, uh, your- one of your TV dinners.
Therapist: Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm.
Client: So you bring those in and you open them up and put them in the microwave and there's vegetables there.
Therapist: Yeah they look pretty good on the plate, don't they?
Client: Yeah, it looks- it looks fine, you know, et cetera. I mean, so that will happen occasionally if I've got a night in. But cooking-wise, no, I haven't cooked anything, um, other than boil the water for the kettle for a cup o coffee.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -for ages.
Therapist: They're food choices in what you eat and what's in your diet it's not what-something you actually you've actually been aware of or had to think about in the past.

Return ""simple"", ""complex"" or ""none"" based on whether the last therapist's utterance  has a simple, complex or no reflection. 
Feel free to return none as the therapist utterance might not have any reflection.

Here are a few examples.

Examples:

Example 1
Client: But-but the wheezing is something that I've definitely noticed a little bit.
Therapist: I guess I also wonder whether, regardless of-of if your asthma symptoms are connected to Oscar, that may be part of you feels like it's worth it because he's been-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: -such a big part of your life for so long.
Answer: complex

Example 2
Client: Um, I'm just- yeah I just like to have a few drinks. I mean, you know, obviously, I-I have, uh, this diagnosed condition, and-and I think, you know, if I were able to, you know, maybe take a few hits off of the joint and have a couple of beers, I think that's about the same as taking the medicine.
Therapist: Well, you know, what, I-- There are a lot of people that wouldn't disagree with you on that exactly. You know, so, um, uh, but I know that they-they were never quite sure how they were all interacting all together. Like the, um- the weed kind of tends to make people a little paranoid anyway.
Client: Yeah, I-I-I got to be careful with it. If I take more than a hit or two of it, it-it-it can be a bit of a problem.
Therapist: Yeah. Why, what happens if you take a little too much of it?
Answer: none

Example 3
Client: That's a good way to sum it up. And it's-- Well, you understand it, uh, it's just- it's not good.
Therapist: Mm. So, and then you said, you don't like how it makes you act, um, if you can tell me a little bit about that.
Answer: simple

Example 4
Client: Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know.
Therapist: But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?
Answer: complex

Example 5
Client: I wanna stay friends with them. I don't want- I don't want them to just-
Therapist: You don't wanna lose your support group, yeah. You just wanna them to support you in being healthy, while helping them, raising the babe, and so we're just taking path B. You don't wanna lose them, just maybe the lifestyle it sounds like.
Answer: none

Example 6
Client: Um, I mean, I guess- I guess I need some strategies for figuring out how to ease stress without, I guess, getting high.
Therapist: Okay. And that's a very good reason for being here. Um, can you talk to me about maybe some of your-- the goals that you have?
Answer: none

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: Thanks for coming in today. I guess you've, uh, sat in that seat with lots of people like me in the past.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: Yeah. And you have some ideas about that and some experiences about that. So today I wanna- be good for us to talk about that and, um, I'm really interested to know what you've been thinking about in terms of what you may wanna change in your life 'cause we're gonna be working together for a while here.
Client: Right. Neat. What, um, what have I changed, what am I—
Therapist: What you've been thinking about, um, over the last little while about getting your life back on track. 'Cause I noticed you've—
Client: I've been thinking about how easy it would be to deal P again.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I've been thinking about, um, how I could actually set myself up the right way doing it the wrong way.
Therapist: Sure. So what I'm picking up is-is that-that-that's a life that you know a lot about.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: And you can make lots of money and set yourself up well. What's the other side, because I guess when I talk to guys like yourself who have done time, often they're thinking about actually, mm, maybe life can be with different. So I'm wondering where-where you're at with the kind of thinking about—
Client: Well, at the end of, you know, that last week inside, I was- I had that kind of, okay, what's next buzz? And, you know, it just doesn't work out here.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: I don't have a, uh, uh, I don't know what that is.
Therapist: Sure. So life on the outside is pretty different than the kind of-
Client: Yes.
Therapist: -the expectation of life on the inside something?
Client: Yeah, it's worse.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So tell me how you've been managing. 'Cause I don't know if you'd been back dealing? How have you been managing to-to-to—
Client: I haven't yet, I mean-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -the, uh, the offer's there.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Um, I don't know why I haven't said that I will yet but I mean-
Therapist: Uh, tell me-
Client: -it's there.
Therapist: It's there and-and-and you've a lot of contacts?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: You've been in the system, so lots of context. So this isn't a new challenge for you.
Client: No.
Therapist: So what stopped you over the last-- How long have you been out now?
Client: How long have I been out?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Three weeks, one day.
Therapist: Three weeks, isn't it?
Client: Three weeks, one day.
Therapist: So what's been there? What's it about that you haven't done in three weeks one day?
Client: I don't know.
Therapist: 22 days you've actually made a decision not to-to pick up your old life and continue on.
Client: Um, I'd- I- you know, I kind of told myself not to, you know, just before I left. And then I'm just kind of with it and I don't quite know why. [clears throat] I dunno, if, uh, there's no real reason why I haven't yet. It's just that I don't- I just don't think it'll work the way I always dream it will you know, I see myself up like, whatever, if I do that again, the next leg is a long one. A real long one.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And I-I can't go back there. There's no way I'm going back there.
Therapist: Right. So the one hand you've-you-you could sit yourself up and-and take the risk, but on the other hand, you know, that actually it might not last?
Client: No, never lasts.
Therapist: Never lasts. Mm. You seem like a bit of a crossroads to me.
Client: Yep. I've been in crossroads for 12 years.
Therapist: Mm. But there've been times when those crossroads would be more sort of focused than other times.
Client: Yeah. And- [crosstalk]
Therapist: Yeah. And it sounds like maybe like-
Client: -sort of opposite, yeah.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: You know, we're in the middle, you know, and it's actually at the moment, I guess.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But I don't know. You know, that's quite clear that no fucking idea.
Therapist: Okay. Okay. So—
Client: Do you have an idea?
Therapist: No. Well, I've-I've got lots of ideas, but I'm really interested to hearing your ideas kind of first though because you know, and there might be some things that we can work on.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: But I guess what I'm really interested in is-is you've made a commitment 22 days, drug-free. Haven't gone back into that lifestyle. What-what's keeping you, 'cause you're at the crossroads, you kind of just pause there at the moment. I'm not sure about this other bit over here. What keeping you in that place?
Client: Fiona?
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Tell me about Fiona?
Client: She's told me that it's over if I do it. You know, I mean, she-- What tell you about, Fiona I mean she's been with me. She's the one who stayed through all the shit. And I owe her-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -something.
Therapist: Okay. So you've been with Fiona for how long?
Client: 12 years.
Therapist: 12 years. Okay. So she's stood by you then for the time, [crosstalk] but this time she said, it happens again I'm out of here?
Client: Yeah. She's actually got the black and white line down now.
Therapist: Okay. And it sounds like you're listening to that black and white line.
Client: It's pretty she- you know, she could be pretty full-on.
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: Yeah, so it's hard to ignore that line.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean. And it comes with a whole lot of different rules, and you know, she's never been quite like she is now.
Therapist: Okay. So something's changed in your relationship between you, yeah?
Client: Yeah. I think she has. I don't think I have.
Therapist: Okay. So what's Fiona want you from you?
Client: She just wants me. I mean, she just wants someone to be there. Me. She-she remembers me and she wants- she wants him.
Therapist: She wants him. So which him does she want, Daryl?
Client: The one that, you know—
Therapist: Does she want the- did she want the-the him that she fell in love with and saw great things in?
Client: Yeah, that's the one.
Therapist: Or does she want the-the-the-the him that's- that keeps on getting into trouble?
Client: No, no. No one would want him. I don't want him. He's a fuckwit, right? She wants the one that she fell in love with.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So what's it gonna take to reclaim this Daryl that she fell in love with?
Client: If I had the answer to that, I wouldn't need to be sitting here.
Therapist: Sure, yeah.
Client: And I mean, I honest- I don't know, man. I don't know. I-I wish I knew somewhere I could start that, you know, could give it to her, but I-I can't. I-I don't know.
Therapist: All right. Well, let's-let's just play with this idea a little bit, Daryl. So what did Fiona fall in love with? What were the qualities of Daryl that she said, ""This is him""?
Client: I was pretty romantic. I mean, I was pretty quite smooth, and, um, you know, I was on top of my game, like, she- and she loved it. And we used to laugh in the [unintelligible 00:06:45], you know? And just- it was always really sweet, and people used to say, ""Oh, man, you two. You two have just got it,"" you know? And we lost it, so whatever that was, that's what she wants. We were young. How do you become young? Uh, you know, I'm old, and we'll keep growing old, but you know?
Therapist: I know.
Client: Like if I'm not careful, I will be.
Therapist: Sure. Everyone will age, but that will happen on time.
Client: Yeah, certainly.
Therapist: Um, but that's okay. So-so it's she fell in love with this, the sense of fun, the sense of Daryl, and things have changed, but she's still with you?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah. And you're still with her?
Client: Yeah, yep.
Therapist: Yeah. So catch me up with the conversations you've had with Fiona about this crossroads you're at. You know, these 22 days, you haven't gone back, you've coming out and you're not back? You could pick up this dealing quite easily and probably some workout here tomorrow and get back into it.
Client: You know what? She hasn't even talked about the dealing, like, she won't even broach that subject. That's how black and white she is. She's- she'll be- she offers suggestions, you know? What I could do, and- or I kind of go with that, but none of them are-- You know, it's lovely that she's really finding things, but they're not the things. I mean, it-- I started kind of placating her and making it okay to keep giving me suggestions, but like, I need to come up with something because it's like awesome love, but you know, not in love, and she's getting sick of it already.
Therapist: Okay. All right. So-so back together, things are starting to get tense at home, and your relationship a little bit?
Client: A little bit that. Yeah, little-little bit tense. Yeah, that's fair.
Therapist: Yeah. Don't put words in your mouth. I'm sure if that is—
Client: No, they are.
Therapist: Oh, yeah? Yeah?
Client: I mean, not like they have been because we've only just started on the new road, but I mean, yeah, tense is the right word.
Therapist: Second, I'd like to talk, Daryl, about this all- whole idea, that's this crossroads idea, yep? So on the one hand here, you've got this 12 year history of being in the other system and done some time and being away from Fiona, but you're now back, sitting back together, and you've got some choice about where to go. So, in that 'where to go', what ideas have you been thinking about in terms of where this-this Daryl, non-dealing [crosstalk] guy—
Client: Well, I don't know. I haven't got little, um, nuggets of where I could go. I've just got like this feeling that I should go somewhere.
Therapist: Okay. Yep. So a part of you knows you need to go something different, but the direction doesn't seem to be that clear at the moment?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: It [unintelligible 00:09:33] picking up?
Client: Yeah. No idea.
Therapist: No idea. Okay. So I'm wondering, you've been in the system a while. You're now 34, is it right from the pick-up?
Client: [nods].
Therapist: Yeah. So, you know, often at 34, guys start to think about being with a girl in their life and what's important. And-and you would have also been part- not as a guy, so they've actually made some shifts and changes and thought, ""Time to move on"".
Client: Yeah. Well, um—
Therapist: And now you've got—
Client: Not many.
Therapist: Not many?
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: But some.
Client: Um, oh, I've got. Yeah, one. [chuckles]
Therapist: One?
Client: One.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Mm, yeah.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Okay, so, um—
Therapist: Tell me something about that.
Client: Well, he-he was- he was inside with me the first time I was ever inside, and now he's a drug counselor.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: So, he's the- he did it.
Therapist: He did it?
Client: I don't know how the fuck he did that, but, 'cause because he wasn't even a real addict, he was just-- Well, I mean, I don't know. He's very good with people.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Really good at talking, and, uh, but anyway, I don't know how he did it.
Therapist: Cool. So how interested would you be to find out more information about how he did it? 'Cause I'm thinking about this is someone who you know, you've done time with, got a relationship.
Client: Yeah, but I can't ever be a drug counselor.
Therapist: No, I'm not suggesting you-- No, not about being a drug counselor, but about he made that transition from-from being involved in crime-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -to a transition about being in a different place.
Client: Yeah. I think he would have found some higher power. They find-- I'm not gonna find one of them.
Therapist: Okay, no 12-step higher power idea?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So that might work for him, but what might work for you?
Client: I don't know. That's why I'm here.
Therapist: Sure.
Client: I don't know what that is.
Therapist: Okay, so part of being here with me, and the work we might do, will be to find- try and find- search for that-
Client: Okay.
Therapist: -thing. Whatever it is.
Client: Good luck.
Therapist: Well, it's a search, isn't it?
Client: Yeah, I don't mean to be rude-
Therapist: No.
Client: -but I do mean it's a big ask.
Therapist: Yep, it is a big ask. So what qualities would you need to have to-to go there?
Client: Fucking guts.
Therapist: Guts? Yeah?
Client: Is it a quality?
Therapist: I think it is.
Client: Yeah, I'd need some of them.
Therapist: Yeah? So you're the sort of guy, Daryl, with guts?
Client: Am I?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: No, not yet.
Therapist: Not yet?
Client: Well, no I'm not.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: No, I don't have that-that-that much courage.\
Therapist: Yet you're sitting here with me today-
Client: Oh, I have to.
Therapist: -and-and-and you're talking about stuff.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Well, you're sitting here, and you're talking with me-
Client: Oh, okay.
Therapist: -about stuff that's-that's quite deep-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -in a way. Um, that takes guts. That takes courage.
Client: All right.
Therapist: In my view, it does.
Client: Okay.
Therapist: 'Cause you could've come in here and said-
Client: It's a bit awkward.
Therapist: -""Look, Ken, you know, I'll come in, report in, I'm outta here.""
Client: Ah, yeah. I could've done that
Therapist: You could've done that, but you're not. So I'm wondering what's different? 'Cause you may have done that in the past, I don't know, Daryl, with other people like me, but-but sounds like something's different this time.
Client: I'm older, you know? It's not as much fun.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: I used to take the piss outta you guys-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -all day long. We all do, but-
Therapist: Sure.
Client: -it's not funny. I mean, and you're-you're a good guy, I imagine. I mean, in fact, you don't deserve my shit. I just-- I don't know. Good luck.
Therapist: I kind of see a sense of sadness there when you have to kind of think about this.
Client: Oh, sadness. You know, I don't wanna wallow, you know? You know, you've gotta take, you know-- You make your own opportunity in life, don't you?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I just never did.
Therapist: Okay. So I'm interested in this idea, let's, uh-- Opportunities come and go all the time.
Client: Do they?
Therapist: They do.
Client: All right. Not to me.
Therapist: Well you said before you had an opportunity to pick up and start dealing again.
Client: Oh, yeah. Oh, heaps of those opportunities.
Therapist: And-and so-so-so there's opportunities- there's opportunities in one world, and I'm wondering about what might make it hard to see opportunities in a different world?
Client: Yeah, well, the different world isn't offering me opportunities. The different world is offering me a night shift, and minimum wage, and, you know, nothing. So it's like, set-set yourself up, set your goal up, or, um, don't, and that's your-your pro-social living, and that's your, you know, old behaviors.
Therapist: Sure, sure. You're in the system-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: -you're not in the system. Pick up that, where is it gonna take you?
Client: The system?
Therapist: Yeah, what-what's gonna happen if you start dealing again?
Client: Man, I've been fighting that system-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -and all it takes me back is to the-the inside-

Client: -I mean—
Therapist: So-So again, I'm-I'm wondering about this other world, and you're saying it doesn't look to attractive at the moment.

Feel free to return none as the therapist utterance might not have any reflection.

Here are a few examples.

Examples:

Example 1
Client: But-but the wheezing is something that I've definitely noticed a little bit.
Therapist: I guess I also wonder whether, regardless of-of if your asthma symptoms are connected to Oscar, that may be part of you feels like it's worth it because he's been-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: -such a big part of your life for so long.
Answer: complex

Example 2
Client: Um, I'm just- yeah I just like to have a few drinks. I mean, you know, obviously, I-I have, uh, this diagnosed condition, and-and I think, you know, if I were able to, you know, maybe take a few hits off of the joint and have a couple of beers, I think that's about the same as taking the medicine.
Therapist: Well, you know, what, I-- There are a lot of people that wouldn't disagree with you on that exactly. You know, so, um, uh, but I know that they-they were never quite sure how they were all interacting all together. Like the, um- the weed kind of tends to make people a little paranoid anyway.
Client: Yeah, I-I-I got to be careful with it. If I take more than a hit or two of it, it-it-it can be a bit of a problem.
Therapist: Yeah. Why, what happens if you take a little too much of it?
Answer: none

Example 3
Client: That's a good way to sum it up. And it's-- Well, you understand it, uh, it's just- it's not good.
Therapist: Mm. So, and then you said, you don't like how it makes you act, um, if you can tell me a little bit about that.
Answer: simple

Example 4
Client: Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know.
Therapist: But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?
Answer: complex

Example 5
Client: I wanna stay friends with them. I don't want- I don't want them to just-
Therapist: You don't wanna lose your support group, yeah. You just wanna them to support you in being healthy, while helping them, raising the babe, and so we're just taking path B. You don't wanna lose them, just maybe the lifestyle it sounds like.
Answer: none

Example 6
Client: Um, I mean, I guess- I guess I need some strategies for figuring out how to ease stress without, I guess, getting high.
Therapist: Okay. And that's a very good reason for being here. Um, can you talk to me about maybe some of your-- the goals that you have?
Answer: none

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: Hi, Jean. I'm Dr. Selby. Nice to meet you.
Client: Good morning, doctor.
Therapist: How can I help you today?
Client: Well, doctor, I-I made an appointment with you finally, because I was diagnosed over three months ago with a pulmonary disease, COPD.
Therapist: Yes.
Client: And although I didn't call right away. I really need some help in quitting smoking.
Therapist: Right.
Client: So I thought, well, this is my first step. So, uh, it's time to do something.
Therapist: It's time to do something, okay. So you've been diagnosed by-
Client: A respirologist.
Therapist: A respirologist diagnosed that, and-and how are you feeling right now?
Client: I'm- I'm really scared, uh, 'cause I don't feel well.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: I haven't felt well for a while. I'm getting coughing fits even when I'm on the telephone with customers.
Therapist: All right. So it sounds like you've been smoking for such a long time and then this diagnosis was given to you, uh, and now that's really causing you to be afraid and frightened.
Client: Mm-hmm. I-I don't know what I'm going to do about it.
Therapist: Okay, okay. Now, have you thought about when you wanted to quit by?
Client: I'm giving myself six months, six months and-and, uh, that seems like a long time away, but I have a feeling I'm going to fail at this point in time. I don't even have 50%, uh, faith in myself.
Therapist: Okay. So what I'm hearing you say is that, although you want to quit smoking in the next six months, you're feeling a bit, um, under-confident that you'll actually be able to do this and you're-you're worried about failing.
Client: I don't know what to do. I've tried to quit smoking. I've had, uh, I've taken pills, I've taken the patch.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: I've gone through therapy. Uh, nothing's helped. I finally- I went to the doctor. I was actually in the hospital. They took me to the hospital for a week. That's the longest I quit.
Therapist: Right. So you've been able to quit smoking, but only when you were in the hospital.
Client: I had no choice, I had no choice. And then the next day I was back to smoking again what I smoked.
Therapist: Okay. Let me just step back a little bit and ask you a question so that I can better understand where the difficulty that you're having with is. Uh, could you tell me what is good about smoking for you?
Client: Uh, it's part of my life. It's, uh, I started smoking when I was 13, 14 at home. My parents smoked. All of their friends smoked. It was on television. Everybody looked so grand.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: Uh, smoking and all dressed up and-and fancy clothes and maybe having a drink in their hands and having a nice meal, um, I didn't really think about it. It's just an extension of me, I guess. It's-it's good for my nerves.
Therapist: Right.
Client: I mean, I feel like it is. I know when I've got that package in my pocket, or I know if there- if I'm going through some stress, I say, ""Oh, well, I'll have a cigarette and think this out.""
Therapist: Sure. So, Jean, I want to make sure that I've understood what you've told me of what you find good about smoking. So it helps you calm down. It gives you something to do. It's been part of your image. You know, you feel sophisticated. You feel like a movie style. In fact, the way you talk about it, it seems like that's what it makes you feel like. Is that right?

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: Thanks for coming in today. I guess you've, uh, sat in that seat with lots of people like me in the past.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: Yeah. And you have some ideas about that and some experiences about that. So today I wanna- be good for us to talk about that and, um, I'm really interested to know what you've been thinking about in terms of what you may wanna change in your life 'cause we're gonna be working together for a while here.
Client: Right. Neat. What, um, what have I changed, what am I—
Therapist: What you've been thinking about, um, over the last little while about getting your life back on track. 'Cause I noticed you've—
Client: I've been thinking about how easy it would be to deal P again.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I've been thinking about, um, how I could actually set myself up the right way doing it the wrong way.
Therapist: Sure. So what I'm picking up is-is that-that-that's a life that you know a lot about.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: And you can make lots of money and set yourself up well. What's the other side, because I guess when I talk to guys like yourself who have done time, often they're thinking about actually, mm, maybe life can be with different. So I'm wondering where-where you're at with the kind of thinking about—
Client: Well, at the end of, you know, that last week inside, I was- I had that kind of, okay, what's next buzz? And, you know, it just doesn't work out here.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: I don't have a, uh, uh, I don't know what that is.
Therapist: Sure. So life on the outside is pretty different than the kind of-
Client: Yes.
Therapist: -the expectation of life on the inside something?
Client: Yeah, it's worse.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So tell me how you've been managing. 'Cause I don't know if you'd been back dealing? How have you been managing to-to-to—
Client: I haven't yet, I mean-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -the, uh, the offer's there.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Um, I don't know why I haven't said that I will yet but I mean-
Therapist: Uh, tell me-
Client: -it's there.
Therapist: It's there and-and-and you've a lot of contacts?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: You've been in the system, so lots of context. So this isn't a new challenge for you.
Client: No.
Therapist: So what stopped you over the last-- How long have you been out now?
Client: How long have I been out?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Three weeks, one day.
Therapist: Three weeks, isn't it?
Client: Three weeks, one day.
Therapist: So what's been there? What's it about that you haven't done in three weeks one day?
Client: I don't know.
Therapist: 22 days you've actually made a decision not to-to pick up your old life and continue on.
Client: Um, I'd- I- you know, I kind of told myself not to, you know, just before I left. And then I'm just kind of with it and I don't quite know why. [clears throat] I dunno, if, uh, there's no real reason why I haven't yet. It's just that I don't- I just don't think it'll work the way I always dream it will you know, I see myself up like, whatever, if I do that again, the next leg is a long one. A real long one.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And I-I can't go back there. There's no way I'm going back there.
Therapist: Right. So the one hand you've-you-you could sit yourself up and-and take the risk, but on the other hand, you know, that actually it might not last?
Client: No, never lasts.
Therapist: Never lasts. Mm. You seem like a bit of a crossroads to me.
Client: Yep. I've been in crossroads for 12 years.
Therapist: Mm. But there've been times when those crossroads would be more sort of focused than other times.
Client: Yeah. And- [crosstalk]
Therapist: Yeah. And it sounds like maybe like-
Client: -sort of opposite, yeah.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: You know, we're in the middle, you know, and it's actually at the moment, I guess.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But I don't know. You know, that's quite clear that no fucking idea.
Therapist: Okay. Okay. So—
Client: Do you have an idea?
Therapist: No. Well, I've-I've got lots of ideas, but I'm really interested to hearing your ideas kind of first though because you know, and there might be some things that we can work on.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: But I guess what I'm really interested in is-is you've made a commitment 22 days, drug-free. Haven't gone back into that lifestyle. What-what's keeping you, 'cause you're at the crossroads, you kind of just pause there at the moment. I'm not sure about this other bit over here. What keeping you in that place?
Client: Fiona?
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Tell me about Fiona?
Client: She's told me that it's over if I do it. You know, I mean, she-- What tell you about, Fiona I mean she's been with me. She's the one who stayed through all the shit. And I owe her-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -something.
Therapist: Okay. So you've been with Fiona for how long?
Client: 12 years.
Therapist: 12 years. Okay. So she's stood by you then for the time, [crosstalk] but this time she said, it happens again I'm out of here?
Client: Yeah. She's actually got the black and white line down now.
Therapist: Okay. And it sounds like you're listening to that black and white line.
Client: It's pretty she- you know, she could be pretty full-on.
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: Yeah, so it's hard to ignore that line.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean. And it comes with a whole lot of different rules, and you know, she's never been quite like she is now.
Therapist: Okay. So something's changed in your relationship between you, yeah?
Client: Yeah. I think she has. I don't think I have.
Therapist: Okay. So what's Fiona want you from you?
Client: She just wants me. I mean, she just wants someone to be there. Me. She-she remembers me and she wants- she wants him.
Therapist: She wants him. So which him does she want, Daryl?
Client: The one that, you know—
Therapist: Does she want the- did she want the-the him that she fell in love with and saw great things in?
Client: Yeah, that's the one.
Therapist: Or does she want the-the-the-the him that's- that keeps on getting into trouble?
Client: No, no. No one would want him. I don't want him. He's a fuckwit, right? She wants the one that she fell in love with.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So what's it gonna take to reclaim this Daryl that she fell in love with?
Client: If I had the answer to that, I wouldn't need to be sitting here.
Therapist: Sure, yeah.
Client: And I mean, I honest- I don't know, man. I don't know. I-I wish I knew somewhere I could start that, you know, could give it to her, but I-I can't. I-I don't know.
Therapist: All right. Well, let's-let's just play with this idea a little bit, Daryl. So what did Fiona fall in love with? What were the qualities of Daryl that she said, ""This is him""?
Client: I was pretty romantic. I mean, I was pretty quite smooth, and, um, you know, I was on top of my game, like, she- and she loved it. And we used to laugh in the [unintelligible 00:06:45], you know? And just- it was always really sweet, and people used to say, ""Oh, man, you two. You two have just got it,"" you know? And we lost it, so whatever that was, that's what she wants. We were young. How do you become young? Uh, you know, I'm old, and we'll keep growing old, but you know?
Therapist: I know.
Client: Like if I'm not careful, I will be.
Therapist: Sure. Everyone will age, but that will happen on time.
Client: Yeah, certainly.
Therapist: Um, but that's okay. So-so it's she fell in love with this, the sense of fun, the sense of Daryl, and things have changed, but she's still with you?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah. And you're still with her?
Client: Yeah, yep.
Therapist: Yeah. So catch me up with the conversations you've had with Fiona about this crossroads you're at. You know, these 22 days, you haven't gone back, you've coming out and you're not back? You could pick up this dealing quite easily and probably some workout here tomorrow and get back into it.
Client: You know what? She hasn't even talked about the dealing, like, she won't even broach that subject. That's how black and white she is. She's- she'll be- she offers suggestions, you know? What I could do, and- or I kind of go with that, but none of them are-- You know, it's lovely that she's really finding things, but they're not the things. I mean, it-- I started kind of placating her and making it okay to keep giving me suggestions, but like, I need to come up with something because it's like awesome love, but you know, not in love, and she's getting sick of it already.
Therapist: Okay. All right. So-so back together, things are starting to get tense at home, and your relationship a little bit?
Client: A little bit that. Yeah, little-little bit tense. Yeah, that's fair.
Therapist: Yeah. Don't put words in your mouth. I'm sure if that is—
Client: No, they are.
Therapist: Oh, yeah? Yeah?
Client: I mean, not like they have been because we've only just started on the new road, but I mean, yeah, tense is the right word.
Therapist: Second, I'd like to talk, Daryl, about this all- whole idea, that's this crossroads idea, yep? So on the one hand here, you've got this 12 year history of being in the other system and done some time and being away from Fiona, but you're now back, sitting back together, and you've got some choice about where to go. So, in that 'where to go', what ideas have you been thinking about in terms of where this-this Daryl, non-dealing [crosstalk] guy—
Client: Well, I don't know. I haven't got little, um, nuggets of where I could go. I've just got like this feeling that I should go somewhere.
Therapist: Okay. Yep. So a part of you knows you need to go something different, but the direction doesn't seem to be that clear at the moment?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: It [unintelligible 00:09:33] picking up?
Client: Yeah. No idea.
Therapist: No idea. Okay. So I'm wondering, you've been in the system a while. You're now 34, is it right from the pick-up?
Client: [nods].
Therapist: Yeah. So, you know, often at 34, guys start to think about being with a girl in their life and what's important. And-and you would have also been part- not as a guy, so they've actually made some shifts and changes and thought, ""Time to move on"".
Client: Yeah. Well, um—
Therapist: And now you've got—
Client: Not many.
Therapist: Not many?
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: But some.
Client: Um, oh, I've got. Yeah, one. [chuckles]
Therapist: One?
Client: One.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Mm, yeah.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Okay, so, um—
Therapist: Tell me something about that.
Client: Well, he-he was- he was inside with me the first time I was ever inside, and now he's a drug counselor.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: So, he's the- he did it.
Therapist: He did it?
Client: I don't know how the fuck he did that, but, 'cause because he wasn't even a real addict, he was just-- Well, I mean, I don't know. He's very good with people.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Really good at talking, and, uh, but anyway, I don't know how he did it.
Therapist: Cool. So how interested would you be to find out more information about how he did it? 'Cause I'm thinking about this is someone who you know, you've done time with, got a relationship.
Client: Yeah, but I can't ever be a drug counselor.
Therapist: No, I'm not suggesting you-- No, not about being a drug counselor, but about he made that transition from-from being involved in crime-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -to a transition about being in a different place.
Client: Yeah. I think he would have found some higher power. They find-- I'm not gonna find one of them.
Therapist: Okay, no 12-step higher power idea?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So that might work for him, but what might work for you?
Client: I don't know. That's why I'm here.
Therapist: Sure.
Client: I don't know what that is.
Therapist: Okay, so part of being here with me, and the work we might do, will be to find- try and find- search for that-
Client: Okay.
Therapist: -thing. Whatever it is.
Client: Good luck.
Therapist: Well, it's a search, isn't it?
Client: Yeah, I don't mean to be rude-
Therapist: No.
Client: -but I do mean it's a big ask.
Therapist: Yep, it is a big ask. So what qualities would you need to have to-to go there?
Client: Fucking guts.
Therapist: Guts? Yeah?
Client: Is it a quality?
Therapist: I think it is.
Client: Yeah, I'd need some of them.
Therapist: Yeah? So you're the sort of guy, Daryl, with guts?
Client: Am I?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: No, not yet.
Therapist: Not yet?
Client: Well, no I'm not.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: No, I don't have that-that-that much courage.\
Therapist: Yet you're sitting here with me today-
Client: Oh, I have to.
Therapist: -and-and-and you're talking about stuff.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Well, you're sitting here, and you're talking with me-
Client: Oh, okay.
Therapist: -about stuff that's-that's quite deep-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -in a way. Um, that takes guts. That takes courage.
Client: All right.
Therapist: In my view, it does.
Client: Okay.
Therapist: 'Cause you could've come in here and said-
Client: It's a bit awkward.
Therapist: -""Look, Ken, you know, I'll come in, report in, I'm outta here.""
Client: Ah, yeah. I could've done that
Therapist: You could've done that, but you're not. So I'm wondering what's different? 'Cause you may have done that in the past, I don't know, Daryl, with other people like me, but-but sounds like something's different this time.
Client: I'm older, you know? It's not as much fun.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: I used to take the piss outta you guys-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -all day long. We all do, but-
Therapist: Sure.
Client: -it's not funny. I mean, and you're-you're a good guy, I imagine. I mean, in fact, you don't deserve my shit. I just-- I don't know. Good luck.
Therapist: I kind of see a sense of sadness there when you have to kind of think about this.
Client: Oh, sadness. You know, I don't wanna wallow, you know? You know, you've gotta take, you know-- You make your own opportunity in life, don't you?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I just never did.
Therapist: Okay. So I'm interested in this idea, let's, uh-- Opportunities come and go all the time.
Client: Do they?
Therapist: They do.
Client: All right. Not to me.
Therapist: Well you said before you had an opportunity to pick up and start dealing again.
Client: Oh, yeah. Oh, heaps of those opportunities.
Therapist: And-and so-so-so there's opportunities- there's opportunities in one world, and I'm wondering about what might make it hard to see opportunities in a different world?
Client: Yeah, well, the different world isn't offering me opportunities. The different world is offering me a night shift, and minimum wage, and, you know, nothing. So it's like, set-set yourself up, set your goal up, or, um, don't, and that's your-your pro-social living, and that's your, you know, old behaviors.
Therapist: Sure, sure. You're in the system-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: -you're not in the system. Pick up that, where is it gonna take you?
Client: The system?
Therapist: Yeah, what-what's gonna happen if you start dealing again?
Client: Man, I've been fighting that system-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -and all it takes me back is to the-the inside-
Therapist: Okay, okay.
Client: -I mean—
Therapist: So-So again, I'm-I'm wondering about this other world, and you're saying it doesn't look to attractive at the moment.
Client: Well, I can't see it.
Therapist: You can't se it?
Client: You know what, if I knew what they'd look like-
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: -I-I might, you know, buy that.
Therapist: Yeah? You just described to me how it looked like a minute ago.

Therapist: Well, you know, what, I-- There are a lot of people that wouldn't disagree with you on that exactly.

Answer: none

Example 6
Client: Um, I mean, I guess- I guess I need some strategies for figuring out how to ease stress without, I guess, getting high.

Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: I know a little bit about you from the referral letter from the doctor.
Client: From my GP?
Therapist: From your GP, yeah.
Client: Uh.
Therapist: But before we get to anything, I'll probably want to just ask you a little bit about what's led you to come here today and get a bit of an idea about what's been going on for you.
Client: What's led me to come here?
Therapist: Mm.
Client: My GP.
Therapist: And what did he have to say?
Client: Well, um, you know, I had my sort of, uh, checkup.
Therapist: mm.
Client: And it revealed that apparently, I might have diabetes 2. Well, that's what he says.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Um, I-I think that I feel perfectly well. I-I'm, you know-- I understand people with diabetes are a little bit plumper than I am.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: But, um, that's really why I'm here. I'm on his command, almost.
Therapist: Right, so he kinda gave you a directive?

Client: Um, I'm just- yeah I just like to have a few drinks.

Therapist: Well, you know, what, I-- There are a lot of people that wouldn't disagree with you on that exactly.

Client: Mm.
Therapist: Yeah. And you have some ideas about that and some experiences about that. So today I wanna- be good for us to talk about that and, um, I'm really interested to know what you've been thinking about in terms of what you may wanna change in your life 'cause we're gonna be working together for a while here.
Client: Right. Neat. What, um, what have I changed, what am I—
Therapist: What you've been thinking about, um, over the last little while about getting your life back on track. 'Cause I noticed you've—
Client: I've been thinking about how easy it would be to deal P again.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I've been thinking about, um, how I could actually set myself up the right way doing it the wrong way.
Therapist: Sure. So what I'm picking up is-is that-that-that's a life that you know a lot about.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: And you can make lots of money and set yourself up well. What's the other side, because I guess when I talk to guys like yourself who have done time, often they're thinking about actually, mm, maybe life can be with different. So I'm wondering where-where you're at with the kind of thinking about—
Client: Well, at the end of, you know, that last week inside, I was- I had that kind of, okay, what's next buzz? And, you know, it just doesn't work out here.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: I don't have a, uh, uh, I don't know what that is.
Therapist: Sure. So life on the outside is pretty different than the kind of-
Client: Yes.
Therapist: -the expectation of life on the inside something?
Client: Yeah, it's worse.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So tell me how you've been managing. 'Cause I don't know if you'd been back dealing? How have you been managing to-to-to—
Client: I haven't yet, I mean-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -the, uh, the offer's there.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Um, I don't know why I haven't said that I will yet but I mean-
Therapist: Uh, tell me-
Client: -it's there.
Therapist: It's there and-and-and you've a lot of contacts?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: You've been in the system, so lots of context. So this isn't a new challenge for you.
Client: No.
Therapist: So what stopped you over the last-- How long have you been out now?
Client: How long have I been out?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Three weeks, one day.
Therapist: Three weeks, isn't it?
Client: Three weeks, one day.
Therapist: So what's been there? What's it about that you haven't done in three weeks one day?
Client: I don't know.
Therapist: 22 days you've actually made a decision not to-to pick up your old life and continue on.
Client: Um, I'd- I- you know, I kind of told myself not to, you know, just before I left. And then I'm just kind of with it and I don't quite know why. [clears throat] I dunno, if, uh, there's no real reason why I haven't yet. It's just that I don't- I just don't think it'll work the way I always dream it will you know, I see myself up like, whatever, if I do that again, the next leg is a long one. A real long one.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And I-I can't go back there. There's no way I'm going back there.
Therapist: Right. So the one hand you've-you-you could sit yourself up and-and take the risk, but on the other hand, you know, that actually it might not last?
Client: No, never lasts.
Therapist: Never lasts. Mm. You seem like a bit of a crossroads to me.
Client: Yep. I've been in crossroads for 12 years.
Therapist: Mm. But there've been times when those crossroads would be more sort of focused than other times.
Client: Yeah. And- [crosstalk]
Therapist: Yeah. And it sounds like maybe like-
Client: -sort of opposite, yeah.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: You know, we're in the middle, you know, and it's actually at the moment, I guess.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But I don't know. You know, that's quite clear that no fucking idea.
Therapist: Okay. Okay. So—
Client: Do you have an idea?
Therapist: No. Well, I've-I've got lots of ideas, but I'm really interested to hearing your ideas kind of first though because you know, and there might be some things that we can work on.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: But I guess what I'm really interested in is-is you've made a commitment 22 days, drug-free. Haven't gone back into that lifestyle. What-what's keeping you, 'cause you're at the crossroads, you kind of just pause there at the moment. I'm not sure about this other bit over here. What keeping you in that place?
Client: Fiona?
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Tell me about Fiona?
Client: She's told me that it's over if I do it. You know, I mean, she-- What tell you about, Fiona I mean she's been with me. She's the one who stayed through all the shit. And I owe her-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -something.
Therapist: Okay. So you've been with Fiona for how long?
Client: 12 years.
Therapist: 12 years. Okay. So she's stood by you then for the time, [crosstalk] but this time she said, it happens again I'm out of here?
Client: Yeah. She's actually got the black and white line down now.
Therapist: Okay. And it sounds like you're listening to that black and white line.
Client: It's pretty she- you know, she could be pretty full-on.
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: Yeah, so it's hard to ignore that line.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean. And it comes with a whole lot of different rules, and you know, she's never been quite like she is now.
Therapist: Okay. So something's changed in your relationship between you, yeah?
Client: Yeah. I think she has. I don't think I have.
Therapist: Okay. So what's Fiona want you from you?
Client: She just wants me. I mean, she just wants someone to be there. Me. She-she remembers me and she wants- she wants him.
Therapist: She wants him. So which him does she want, Daryl?
Client: The one that, you know—
Therapist: Does she want the- did she want the-the him that she fell in love with and saw great things in?
Client: Yeah, that's the one.
Therapist: Or does she want the-the-the-the him that's- that keeps on getting into trouble?
Client: No, no. No one would want him. I don't want him. He's a fuckwit, right? She wants the one that she fell in love with.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So what's it gonna take to reclaim this Daryl that she fell in love with?
Client: If I had the answer to that, I wouldn't need to be sitting here.
Therapist: Sure, yeah.
Client: And I mean, I honest- I don't know, man. I don't know. I-I wish I knew somewhere I could start that, you know, could give it to her, but I-I can't. I-I don't know.
Therapist: All right. Well, let's-let's just play with this idea a little bit, Daryl. So what did Fiona fall in love with? What were the qualities of Daryl that she said, ""This is him""?
Client: I was pretty romantic. I mean, I was pretty quite smooth, and, um, you know, I was on top of my game, like, she- and she loved it. And we used to laugh in the [unintelligible 00:06:45], you know? And just- it was always really sweet, and people used to say, ""Oh, man, you two. You two have just got it,"" you know? And we lost it, so whatever that was, that's what she wants. We were young. How do you become young? Uh, you know, I'm old, and we'll keep growing old, but you know?
Therapist: I know.
Client: Like if I'm not careful, I will be.
Therapist: Sure. Everyone will age, but that will happen on time.
Client: Yeah, certainly.
Therapist: Um, but that's okay. So-so it's she fell in love with this, the sense of fun, the sense of Daryl, and things have changed, but she's still with you?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah. And you're still with her?
Client: Yeah, yep.
Therapist: Yeah. So catch me up with the conversations you've had with Fiona about this crossroads you're at. You know, these 22 days, you haven't gone back, you've coming out and you're not back? You could pick up this dealing quite easily and probably some workout here tomorrow and get back into it.
Client: You know what? She hasn't even talked about the dealing, like, she won't even broach that subject. That's how black and white she is. She's- she'll be- she offers suggestions, you know? What I could do, and- or I kind of go with that, but none of them are-- You know, it's lovely that she's really finding things, but they're not the things. I mean, it-- I started kind of placating her and making it okay to keep giving me suggestions, but like, I need to come up with something because it's like awesome love, but you know, not in love, and she's getting sick of it already.
Therapist: Okay. All right. So-so back together, things are starting to get tense at home, and your relationship a little bit?
Client: A little bit that. Yeah, little-little bit tense. Yeah, that's fair.
Therapist: Yeah. Don't put words in your mouth. I'm sure if that is—
Client: No, they are.
Therapist: Oh, yeah? Yeah?
Client: I mean, not like they have been because we've only just started on the new road, but I mean, yeah, tense is the right word.
Therapist: Second, I'd like to talk, Daryl, about this all- whole idea, that's this crossroads idea, yep? So on the one hand here, you've got this 12 year history of being in the other system and done some time and being away from Fiona, but you're now back, sitting back together, and you've got some choice about where to go. So, in that 'where to go', what ideas have you been thinking about in terms of where this-this Daryl, non-dealing [crosstalk] guy—
Client: Well, I don't know. I haven't got little, um, nuggets of where I could go. I've just got like this feeling that I should go somewhere.
Therapist: Okay. Yep. So a part of you knows you need to go something different, but the direction doesn't seem to be that clear at the moment?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: It [unintelligible 00:09:33] picking up?
Client: Yeah. No idea.
Therapist: No idea. Okay. So I'm wondering, you've been in the system a while. You're now 34, is it right from the pick-up?
Client: [nods].
Therapist: Yeah. So, you know, often at 34, guys start to think about being with a girl in their life and what's important. And-and you would have also been part- not as a guy, so they've actually made some shifts and changes and thought, ""Time to move on"".
Client: Yeah. Well, um—
Therapist: And now you've got—
Client: Not many.
Therapist: Not many?
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: But some.
Client: Um, oh, I've got. Yeah, one. [chuckles]
Therapist: One?
Client: One.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Mm, yeah.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Okay, so, um—
Therapist: Tell me something about that.
Client: Well, he-he was- he was inside with me the first time I was ever inside, and now he's a drug counselor.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: So, he's the- he did it.
Therapist: He did it?
Client: I don't know how the fuck he did that, but, 'cause because he wasn't even a real addict, he was just-- Well, I mean, I don't know. He's very good with people.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Really good at talking, and, uh, but anyway, I don't know how he did it.
Therapist: Cool. So how interested would you be to find out more information about how he did it? 'Cause I'm thinking about this is someone who you know, you've done time with, got a relationship.
Client: Yeah, but I can't ever be a drug counselor.
Therapist: No, I'm not suggesting you-- No, not about being a drug counselor, but about he made that transition from-from being involved in crime-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -to a transition about being in a different place.
Client: Yeah. I think he would have found some higher power. They find-- I'm not gonna find one of them.
Therapist: Okay, no 12-step higher power idea?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So that might work for him, but what might work for you?
Client: I don't know. That's why I'm here.
Therapist: Sure.
Client: I don't know what that is.
Therapist: Okay, so part of being here with me, and the work we might do, will be to find- try and find- search for that-
Client: Okay.
Therapist: -thing. Whatever it is.
Client: Good luck.
Therapist: Well, it's a search, isn't it?
Client: Yeah, I don't mean to be rude-
Therapist: No.
Client: -but I do mean it's a big ask.
Therapist: Yep, it is a big ask. So what qualities would you need to have to-to go there?
Client: Fucking guts.
Therapist: Guts? Yeah?
Client: Is it a quality?
Therapist: I think it is.
Client: Yeah, I'd need some of them.
Therapist: Yeah? So you're the sort of guy, Daryl, with guts?
Client: Am I?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: No, not yet.
Therapist: Not yet?
Client: Well, no I'm not.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: No, I don't have that-that-that much courage.\
Therapist: Yet you're sitting here with me today-
Client: Oh, I have to.
Therapist: -and-and-and you're talking about stuff.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Well, you're sitting here, and you're talking with me-
Client: Oh, okay.
Therapist: -about stuff that's-that's quite deep-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -in a way. Um, that takes guts. That takes courage.
Client: All right.
Therapist: In my view, it does.
Client: Okay.
Therapist: 'Cause you could've come in here and said-
Client: It's a bit awkward.
Therapist: -""Look, Ken, you know, I'll come in, report in, I'm outta here.""
Client: Ah, yeah. I could've done that
Therapist: You could've done that, but you're not. So I'm wondering what's different? 'Cause you may have done that in the past, I don't know, Daryl, with other people like me, but-but sounds like something's different this time.
Client: I'm older, you know? It's not as much fun.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: I used to take the piss outta you guys-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -all day long. We all do, but-
Therapist: Sure.
Client: -it's not funny. I mean, and you're-you're a good guy, I imagine. I mean, in fact, you don't deserve my shit. I just-- I don't know. Good luck.
Therapist: I kind of see a sense of sadness there when you have to kind of think about this.
Client: Oh, sadness. You know, I don't wanna wallow, you know? You know, you've gotta take, you know-- You make your own opportunity in life, don't you?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I just never did.
Therapist: Okay. So I'm interested in this idea, let's, uh-- Opportunities come and go all the time.
Client: Do they?
Therapist: They do.
Client: All right. Not to me.
Therapist: Well you said before you had an opportunity to pick up and start dealing again.
Client: Oh, yeah. Oh, heaps of those opportunities.
Therapist: And-and so-so-so there's opportunities- there's opportunities in one world, and I'm wondering about what might make it hard to see opportunities in a different world?
Client: Yeah, well, the different world isn't offering me opportunities. The different world is offering me a night shift, and minimum wage, and, you know, nothing. So it's like, set-set yourself up, set your goal up, or, um, don't, and that's your-your pro-social living, and that's your, you know, old behaviors.
Therapist: Sure, sure. You're in the system-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: -you're not in the system. Pick up that, where is it gonna take you?
Client: The system?
Therapist: Yeah, what-what's gonna happen if you start dealing again?
Client: Man, I've been fighting that system-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -and all it takes me back is to the-the inside-
Therapist: Okay, okay.
Client: -I mean—
Therapist: So-So again, I'm-I'm wondering about this other world, and you're saying it doesn't look to attractive at the moment.
Client: Well, I can't see it.
Therapist: You can't se it?
Client: You know what, if I knew what they'd look like-
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: -I-I might, you know, buy that.
Therapist: Yeah? You just described to me how it looked like a minute ago.
Client: Did I?
Therapist: Minimum wage-
Client: Oh yeah.
Therapist: -night shift, petrol station.
Client: Yeah, that's not much fun. That doesn't look very good.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah, that looks really hard.
Therapist: Yeah? It is really hard.
Client: I know that's the right thing, uh, don't get me wrong.
Therapist: Sure.
Client: That is gut right there, going to a job you hate, going home, cooking yet missus a dinner, looking after your kids. I mean, that is-- That's what it real mean does, but I don't have that-- Th-those guts to do- to do what you do.
Therapist: Sure. We talked about courage before and you've got the guts to be talking with me about this stuff today, and I'm wondering if you actually do have some courage to think about these ideas. I'm not saying that pumping gas at minimum wage is where you wanna go, but-but the guts to actually start steeping into this other world. I wonder if you do have, I'm-I'm-I'm just not sure.

Therapist: Okay.
Client: And I-I can't go back there. There's no way I'm going back there.
Therapist: Right. So the one hand you've-you-you could sit yourself up and-and take the risk, but on the other hand, you know, that actually it might not last?
Client: No, never lasts.
Therapist: Never lasts. Mm. You seem like a bit of a crossroads to me.
Client: Yep. I've been in crossroads for 12 years.
Therapist: Mm. But there've been times when those crossroads would be more sort of focused than other times.
Client: Yeah. And- [crosstalk]
Therapist: Yeah. And it sounds like maybe like-
Client: -sort of opposite, yeah.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: You know, we're in the middle, you know, and it's actually at the moment, I guess.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But I don't know. You know, that's quite clear that no fucking idea.
Therapist: Okay. Okay. So—
Client: Do you have an idea?
Therapist: No. Well, I've-I've got lots of ideas, but I'm really interested to hearing your ideas kind of first though because you know, and there might be some things that we can work on.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: But I guess what I'm really interested in is-is you've made a commitment 22 days, drug-free. Haven't gone back into that lifestyle. What-what's keeping you, 'cause you're at the crossroads, you kind of just pause there at the moment. I'm not sure about this other bit over here. What keeping you in that place?
Client: Fiona?
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Tell me about Fiona?
Client: She's told me that it's over if I do it. You know, I mean, she-- What tell you about, Fiona I mean she's been with me. She's the one who stayed through all the shit. And I owe her-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -something.
Therapist: Okay. So you've been with Fiona for how long?
Client: 12 years.
Therapist: 12 years. Okay. So she's stood by you then for the time, [crosstalk] but this time she said, it happens again I'm out of here?
Client: Yeah. She's actually got the black and white line down now.
Therapist: Okay. And it sounds like you're listening to that black and white line.
Client: It's pretty she- you know, she could be pretty full-on.
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: Yeah, so it's hard to ignore that line.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean. And it comes with a whole lot of different rules, and you know, she's never been quite like she is now.
Therapist: Okay. So something's changed in your relationship between you, yeah?
Client: Yeah. I think she has. I don't think I have.
Therapist: Okay. So what's Fiona want you from you?
Client: She just wants me. I mean, she just wants someone to be there. Me. She-she remembers me and she wants- she wants him.
Therapist: She wants him. So which him does she want, Daryl?
Client: The one that, you know—
Therapist: Does she want the- did she want the-the him that she fell in love with and saw great things in?
Client: Yeah, that's the one.
Therapist: Or does she want the-the-the-the him that's- that keeps on getting into trouble?
Client: No, no. No one would want him. I don't want him. He's a fuckwit, right? She wants the one that she fell in love with.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So what's it gonna take to reclaim this Daryl that she fell in love with?
Client: If I had the answer to that, I wouldn't need to be sitting here.
Therapist: Sure, yeah.
Client: And I mean, I honest- I don't know, man. I don't know. I-I wish I knew somewhere I could start that, you know, could give it to her, but I-I can't. I-I don't know.
Therapist: All right. Well, let's-let's just play with this idea a little bit, Daryl. So what did Fiona fall in love with? What were the qualities of Daryl that she said, ""This is him""?
Client: I was pretty romantic. I mean, I was pretty quite smooth, and, um, you know, I was on top of my game, like, she- and she loved it. And we used to laugh in the [unintelligible 00:06:45], you know? And just- it was always really sweet, and people used to say, ""Oh, man, you two. You two have just got it,"" you know? And we lost it, so whatever that was, that's what she wants. We were young. How do you become young? Uh, you know, I'm old, and we'll keep growing old, but you know?
Therapist: I know.
Client: Like if I'm not careful, I will be.
Therapist: Sure. Everyone will age, but that will happen on time.
Client: Yeah, certainly.
Therapist: Um, but that's okay. So-so it's she fell in love with this, the sense of fun, the sense of Daryl, and things have changed, but she's still with you?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah. And you're still with her?
Client: Yeah, yep.
Therapist: Yeah. So catch me up with the conversations you've had with Fiona about this crossroads you're at. You know, these 22 days, you haven't gone back, you've coming out and you're not back? You could pick up this dealing quite easily and probably some workout here tomorrow and get back into it.
Client: You know what? She hasn't even talked about the dealing, like, she won't even broach that subject. That's how black and white she is. She's- she'll be- she offers suggestions, you know? What I could do, and- or I kind of go with that, but none of them are-- You know, it's lovely that she's really finding things, but they're not the things. I mean, it-- I started kind of placating her and making it okay to keep giving me suggestions, but like, I need to come up with something because it's like awesome love, but you know, not in love, and she's getting sick of it already.
Therapist: Okay. All right. So-so back together, things are starting to get tense at home, and your relationship a little bit?
Client: A little bit that. Yeah, little-little bit tense. Yeah, that's fair.
Therapist: Yeah. Don't put words in your mouth. I'm sure if that is—
Client: No, they are.
Therapist: Oh, yeah? Yeah?
Client: I mean, not like they have been because we've only just started on the new road, but I mean, yeah, tense is the right word.
Therapist: Second, I'd like to talk, Daryl, about this all- whole idea, that's this crossroads idea, yep? So on the one hand here, you've got this 12 year history of being in the other system and done some time and being away from Fiona, but you're now back, sitting back together, and you've got some choice about where to go. So, in that 'where to go', what ideas have you been thinking about in terms of where this-this Daryl, non-dealing [crosstalk] guy—
Client: Well, I don't know. I haven't got little, um, nuggets of where I could go. I've just got like this feeling that I should go somewhere.
Therapist: Okay. Yep. So a part of you knows you need to go something different, but the direction doesn't seem to be that clear at the moment?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: It [unintelligible 00:09:33] picking up?
Client: Yeah. No idea.
Therapist: No idea. Okay. So I'm wondering, you've been in the system a while. You're now 34, is it right from the pick-up?
Client: [nods].
Therapist: Yeah. So, you know, often at 34, guys start to think about being with a girl in their life and what's important. And-and you would have also been part- not as a guy, so they've actually made some shifts and changes and thought, ""Time to move on"".
Client: Yeah. Well, um—
Therapist: And now you've got—
Client: Not many.
Therapist: Not many?
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: But some.
Client: Um, oh, I've got. Yeah, one. [chuckles]
Therapist: One?
Client: One.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Mm, yeah.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Okay, so, um—
Therapist: Tell me something about that.
Client: Well, he-he was- he was inside with me the first time I was ever inside, and now he's a drug counselor.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: So, he's the- he did it.
Therapist: He did it?
Client: I don't know how the fuck he did that, but, 'cause because he wasn't even a real addict, he was just-- Well, I mean, I don't know. He's very good with people.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Really good at talking, and, uh, but anyway, I don't know how he did it.
Therapist: Cool. So how interested would you be to find out more information about how he did it? 'Cause I'm thinking about this is someone who you know, you've done time with, got a relationship.
Client: Yeah, but I can't ever be a drug counselor.
Therapist: No, I'm not suggesting you-- No, not about being a drug counselor, but about he made that transition from-from being involved in crime-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -to a transition about being in a different place.
Client: Yeah. I think he would have found some higher power. They find-- I'm not gonna find one of them.
Therapist: Okay, no 12-step higher power idea?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So that might work for him, but what might work for you?
Client: I don't know. That's why I'm here.
Therapist: Sure.
Client: I don't know what that is.
Therapist: Okay, so part of being here with me, and the work we might do, will be to find- try and find- search for that-
Client: Okay.
Therapist: -thing. Whatever it is.
Client: Good luck.
Therapist: Well, it's a search, isn't it?
Client: Yeah, I don't mean to be rude-
Therapist: No.
Client: -but I do mean it's a big ask.
Therapist: Yep, it is a big ask. So what qualities would you need to have to-to go there?
Client: Fucking guts.
Therapist: Guts? Yeah?
Client: Is it a quality?
Therapist: I think it is.
Client: Yeah, I'd need some of them.
Therapist: Yeah? So you're the sort of guy, Daryl, with guts?
Client: Am I?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: No, not yet.
Therapist: Not yet?
Client: Well, no I'm not.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: No, I don't have that-that-that much courage.\
Therapist: Yet you're sitting here with me today-
Client: Oh, I have to.
Therapist: -and-and-and you're talking about stuff.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Well, you're sitting here, and you're talking with me-
Client: Oh, okay.
Therapist: -about stuff that's-that's quite deep-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -in a way. Um, that takes guts. That takes courage.
Client: All right.
Therapist: In my view, it does.
Client: Okay.
Therapist: 'Cause you could've come in here and said-
Client: It's a bit awkward.
Therapist: -""Look, Ken, you know, I'll come in, report in, I'm outta here.""
Client: Ah, yeah. I could've done that
Therapist: You could've done that, but you're not. So I'm wondering what's different? 'Cause you may have done that in the past, I don't know, Daryl, with other people like me, but-but sounds like something's different this time.

Return ""simple"", ""complex"" or ""none"" based on whether the last therapist's utterance  has a simple, complex or no reflection. 
Feel free to return none as the therapist utterance might not have any reflection.

Here are a few examples.

Examples:

Example 1
Client: But-but the wheezing is something that I've definitely noticed a little bit.
Therapist: I guess I also wonder whether, regardless of-of if your asthma symptoms are connected to Oscar, that may be part of you feels like it's worth it because he's been-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: -such a big part of your life for so long.
Answer: complex

Example 2
Client: Um, I'm just- yeah I just like to have a few drinks. I mean, you know, obviously, I-I have, uh, this diagnosed condition, and-and I think, you know, if I were able to, you know, maybe take a few hits off of the joint and have a couple of beers, I think that's about the same as taking the medicine.
Therapist: Well, you know, what, I-- There are a lot of people that wouldn't disagree with you on that exactly. You know, so, um, uh, but I know that they-they were never quite sure how they were all interacting all together. Like the, um- the weed kind of tends to make people a little paranoid anyway.
Client: Yeah, I-I-I got to be careful with it. If I take more than a hit or two of it, it-it-it can be a bit of a problem.
Therapist: Yeah. Why, what happens if you take a little too much of it?
Answer: none

Example 3
Client: That's a good way to sum it up. And it's-- Well, you understand it, uh, it's just- it's not good.
Therapist: Mm. So, and then you said, you don't like how it makes you act, um, if you can tell me a little bit about that.
Answer: simple

Example 4
Client: Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know.
Therapist: But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?
Answer: complex

Example 5
Client: I wanna stay friends with them. I don't want- I don't want them to just-
Therapist: You don't wanna lose your support group, yeah. You just wanna them to support you in being healthy, while helping them, raising the babe, and so we're just taking path B. You don't wanna lose them, just maybe the lifestyle it sounds like.
Answer: none

Example 6
Client: Um, I mean, I guess- I guess I need some strategies for figuring out how to ease stress without, I guess, getting high.
Therapist: Okay. And that's a very good reason for being here. Um, can you talk to me about maybe some of your-- the goals that you have?
Answer: none

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: Hi, Billy.
Client: Hi.
Therapist: Hi, another session and another session where you are actually on time.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: You've done-- You've got a really good track record of, uh, being on time. Yeah? Do you realize that?
Client: Yeah, no, it's easy.
Therapist: Yeah. Yeah. You know, I've been thinking about, um, thinking about you, and thinking about, um, that first meeting we had, and where you are now. So, wh-what do you think some of the changes are that-that you've made in this- in this, sort of, five-five to six weeks that we've been meeting?
Client: Uh. Meeting's definitely helped.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah. It's helped-
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: -heaps.
Therapist: It's helped heaps?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah? So, what sort of things has it helped with?
Client: Just, uh, someone to talk to and just someone to keep me busy and, kind of, keep me in check.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. So, what changes have you made, Billy?
Client: Um, well, I said I went to the polytech and stuff-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -and I went back there and got another form and stuff, and just helping me with that.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah. And, get-getting to the polytech and getting the forms, that's a pretty big deal.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah? I was thinking about the Billy, say, the Billy of six months ago. I'm wondering if the Billy of six months ago would've done that?
Client: Nah. I didn't really think about it frankly.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. So, what shifted that made it that you were actually able to go to the polytech and get the forms? What's shifted in you?
Client: I don't know. I just thought if, uh, I could get a job and stuff, doing stuff I like, uh, it'll make things easier.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah. Where have you got to with the forms? I mean, we talked about that quite a lot last time.
Client: Yeah. Oh, I know. After talking to you, I got Donna to help me out, and that's just really helpful.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: [clears throat]
Therapist: Okay. So, what did you say to Donna?
Client: [clears throat] Oh, I just said-- I said, ""Uh, could you give me a hand with this?""
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: And, like, she filled them up for me, and I told her what to write.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. So, where did you get to in terms of telling her that, uh, reading and writing is not that [unintelligible 00:27:23] for you?
Client: Just-- I-I asked her to fill that out for me because I said I'd be too messy.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So, I was thinking about how that stuff about not feeling confident around reading and writing has, um, really got in the way for you.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And I mentioned that's somewhere where you don't feel so confident, and I'm wondering what it would be like to feel confident with reading and writing. What difference would that make to your life?
Client: Like, a big difference, but, like, it's not like I don't try.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Like, I'm just not really good with it.
Therapist: Yeah. Yeah, I can really see that you're making an effort. In fact, I can see that you're really making an effort in lots of areas, not just in terms of reading and writing.
Client: Yeah. Like [unintelligible 00:28:13] if I'd got into polytech and stuff, so I think that's good.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So, where are the forms now?
Client: They're still at home.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: Yeah. If—
Therapist: So, what needs to happen next?
Client: Just take them in.
Therapist: So, you actually have to deliver them to the polytech, do you?
Client: Yeah. Uh, I think you can post them, but I'll just drop them in.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. So, when do you think you're gonna do that?
Client: Uh, probably by the end of this week.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. So, by the end of this week, so by next time, when you come here, as in, those forms will be at the polytech?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And what-what happens next in terms of what happens once the forms are there?
Client: I don't know. I don't know if you have to interview or whatever, but I guess, course-- I don't even know any course that I'll do.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. So what's the- what's the-- Say, if you get on the course-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -and, um, you're, like, real good with, uh, hands-on stuff, but the stuff around the manuals, and the assignments, and those sorts of things, um, don't feel so good. What-what do you think we need to do around helping you with that?
Client: Well, um-- Well, I don't know. Hopefully, there's not so much of that stuff. Um, oh, well, I don't know. I could find out maybe someone who can help you, like, at the school, at the polytech, maybe somebody can help you out and stuff, or there might be computers there or something.
Therapist: Mm. Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So, all these changes that you've- that you've made, um, Billy, where-where is the offending fitting into all of that now?
Client: Not really fitting in. It kind of just gets in the way.
Therapist: So, offending gets in the way of the life that you're starting to lead?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah? So, what temptations have you had to, kind of, go back to offending?
Client: Like like getting on the piss, but with Donna, there kind of keeps me busy.
Therapist: Mm. So the drinking is something that we talked about can make it easier for you to offend.

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: All right, Catherine, welcome back. I'll be interested to, sort of, after we met last time, what-what were you-- what have you been thinking about over the week 'cause, you know, I-I remembered last time I asked you what you were thinking about coming, but-
Client: Mm.
Therapist: -what was different this time and your thoughts about coming?
Client: I suppose, my expectations are a wee bit clearer as to why I'm here.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I guess, I'm-- It made me think about how much money I have been losing recently. So, yeah. I'm happier to be here. [chuckles]
Therapist: Okay, okay. So, there's a shift from last time?
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: Yeah. Yeah. My sense is we'll be able to work pretty well together. That's my, sort of, sense of, uh-- After last time, I thought, you know, ""Here's a young woman who's, you know, got some energy to get things together-
Client: Mm.
Therapist: -and, uh--"" So, really, what we'd like to talk about today is-is get a sense of, um-- Let's talk about the things that would be good to work with, um, over the next, you know, nine months together, really.
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: So, one of the things that we started to touch on, last time, was this issue of gambling, and, um, you were talking, last time, about how the gambling had, sort of, got you into trouble with your family.
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: Yeah. So, thinking about, like, you know, last time, you-you started to say that, well, you thought it was-- you deserved it and there was some thinking around that, so I'm, sort of, wondering how open you are to-to exploring that from some different angles?
Client: Yeah. I'm happy to explore it, so to speak. [chuckles]
Therapist: Yeah. Yeah.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah. Yeah.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah, so how-how-- You know, like-- 'Cause, sometimes, when we start to open things up, and then you think, ""Oh, it feels a bit uncomfortable."" So, how do you manage things when you get uncomfortable? How have you managed those in the past?
Client: Hmm. I don't know, I probably lock off a wee bit. [chuckles]
Therapist: Yeah. Yeah. So, how would I know if we were talking and you were blocking off? What would I notice, uh, in our session together?
Client: Yeah, um. I'm sure you've already noticed. [chuckles] Um, I don't know, probably fidget.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: That's why I am still a bit—
Therapist: Yeah, that's okay.
Client: [chuckles]
Therapist: So-so, what would be really helpful maybe because I might miss it, you know, so, like, could you tell me? It would be really helpful if—
Client: When I'm feeling uncomfortable?
Therapist: Yeah, yeah. If you could just say, ""Ken, hi, I am starting to, you know, tune it out here, starting to get uncomfortable,"" that would be really helpful.
Client: Okay.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: Yeah, thanks for that, okay. So, let's think about the-- It has to do with how you just sorted out the thing around the gambling 'cause last time you were here, you told me that you get a buzz, you know, it seemed like you were gambling a bit more than your girlfriends were aware of, and-and you said you owe one of your friends some money.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: So, um, how serious do you think this issue is to sort?
Client: [sighs] I suppose it's really serious if I wanna get out of my-my-my debt.
Therapist: Yeah, okay.
Client: Credit comes out of my ears, and mom and dad aren't bailing me out anymore, so-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -I suppose, I've gotta sort it out myself.
Therapist: Okay. So, again, on a scale of 1 to 100, how serious-- how important is it to sort it out? Yeah.
Client: About 80. [chuckles]
Therapist: About 80? Right up there, yeah, yeah? And another question that's, sort of, related to that, how confident are you that you can, you know, you can actually get it sorted and get on with life?
Client: I'm gonna say, I'm completely confident.
Therapist: Yeah? But, what would-
Client: Yes.
Therapist: -your level be on a scale of 1 to 100? Where does your confidence sit?
Client: What, on my confidence to stop? [chuckles]
Therapist: Well, to get it sorted. Not necessarily to stop. But we don't- we don't know whether-whether stopping's the right answer here, I don't know, but-but, your confidence to sort it out.
Client: It's hard when it's part of your lifestyle, you know?
Therapist: Mm.
Client: When I went with my girlfriends to the pub last night and I went and hit a bit of a flutter-
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: -so, you know, I think I'm a bit weird if I just sit-sit at the bar on my own. [chuckles]
Therapist: Yeah. Yeah, so-so, you fluttered last night with them?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yep. Okay, okay. And-and when they stopped fluttering, were you still fluttering or did you stop with them? Where-where were you with—
Client: Oh, I had to stop halfway 'cause I'd ran out of money. [chuckles]
Therapist: Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So, you were saying before that, you know, there was, you know, money you couldn't really afford-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: -'cause you owed your mom and dad some money, and they weren't bailing you out anymore, and you had to go out and find some money, I think?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah? Yeah. Yep. So, it seems like almost, like, you're still in the behavior, you know, still creating some problems?
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: Yeah? Yeah.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: There's some feelings when you, kind of, think about that?
Client: I don't know, but I'd like to get back on track, but—
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Not really planning on spending my life in debt. [chuckles]
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I don't mind traveling, and, you know, I've got friends that are saving for the [unintelligible 00:18:27] and I'm 25 and working in retail, and got four credit cards-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -so I won't be doing any traveling any time soon.
Therapist: Okay. So, again, that, sort of, sounds really important. So, what's-what's your dreams? What are your dreams? Where do you wanna be in five years' time? Where does Catherine wanna be? What do you wanna be doing? What are your dreams?
Client: Maybe I wanna have traveled and found the man of my dreams. [chuckles]
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: I don't know. Kids maybe, but-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -I'm not gonna- [sighs] I'm not gonna make a decent mom the way I am, at the moment, am I? So I probably need to get on track at some stage. [chuckles] I'll be pushing 30 and still in debt, at this rate.
Therapist: Okay, okay. So, it seems like you're-you're, kind of, in a state in your life of considering your next steps.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah? Yeah. ""Do I continue with the, you know, my little current lifestyle,"" and you are so much the party girl you used to be-- I was speaking to last time-
Client: [chuckles]
Therapist: -wasn't that-- Is that right? Yeah? So, ""Do I live a party lifestyle-- party-girl kind of lifestyle, or am I got some other dreams to follow?"" So, they're hard calls to make. And-and it all-- And there are no three ways. We will have to make those calls at some point.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: And, my sense, is that some of the challenge for you, at the moment? Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: When you think five years ahead, which-which position do you wanna be in? Which-which feels best? Party girl still, you know, with those four credit cards maxed out major, or would you wanna be actually, you know, thinking about having traveled and, you know, maybe, starting a family, those other things? Which-which direction feels best for you at this point?

Answer: complex

Example 2
Client: Um, I'm just- yeah I just like to have a few drinks. I mean, you know, obviously, I-I have, uh, this diagnosed condition, and-and I think, you know, if I were able to, you know, maybe take a few hits off of the joint and have a couple of beers, I think that's about the same as taking the medicine.
Therapist: Well, you know, what, I-- There are a lot of people that wouldn't disagree with you on that exactly. You know, so, um, uh, but I know that they-they were never quite sure how they were all interacting all together. Like the, um- the weed kind of tends to make people a little paranoid anyway.
Client: Yeah, I-I-I got to be careful with it. If I take more than a hit or two of it, it-it-it can be a bit of a problem.
Therapist: Yeah. Why, what happens if you take a little too much of it?
Answer: none

Example 3
Client: That's a good way to sum it up. And it's-- Well, you understand it, uh, it's just- it's not good.

Client: [signs] Kind of slow.
Therapist: Kind of slow?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: What kind of things have you been in your rehab?
Client: Oh, they have me doing all kinds of things in different machines and stuff. Yeah, it hurts.
Therapist: It hurts? Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Where are you having pain?
Client: Well, just about every joint like especially my knees. They're really-- They have me doing some leg things that-that-that is it really necessary?
Therapist: Well, you know, I-I understand that pain is hard to work through but a lot of time when you're having rehab after a stroke, that pain is telling you that your muscles and joints are starting to work again. So you can kind of think of it as a positive way to, you know, know that your-your body's getting back to normal.
Client: Okay.
Therapist: But what are your goals for the long term?
Client: I wanna go home.
Therapist: Oh, of course, of course. And what are the things that you'd like to be able to do once you get home?
Client: Everything. I wanna- I wanna, play with my dog. I miss my dog. I wanna cook for myself. I'm a very independent person and I wanna do things for myself.
Therapist: Yeah, yeah. And so that's a very important goal to be able to get back home, to be able to get back to your independence. Have you thought about what it might take to get there?
Client: Um, I guess the rehab.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. Yeah, you're absolutely right. And it's also going to be very important that once you're home, you're able to continue on a regular activity program. Have you thought about what that might look like?

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: Thank you for coming in today, Katie. I'm looking forward to getting to know you, and maybe just wanna start off with just sharing a little bit about you and what brought you in today?
Client: Uh, yeah, sure. Um, I guess, well, my doctor referred me to see you. Um, I guess he has some concerns about, um, my- my pregnancy and- and my baby. So, um, yeah, well, I'm doing what I'm told.
Therapist: So you're following through on meeting with me today and you mentioned he has some concerns. Can you tell me a little bit about that?
Client: Uh, yeah, he is concerned about my alcohol intake.
Therapist: Okay. And I'm wondering if you have any concerns about that.
Client: Uh, no.
Therapist: No. Okay. So that's- that's not been an issue for you. Uh, it is an issue for him and not for you at this point.
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: Okay. So what about maybe sharing a little bit about your alcohol intake and maybe a little bit about what your- what your life's like a little bit for me today?
Client: Um, okay. Uh, well, I guess I drink like a glass of wine at supper every night, and just to, you know, relax a little with my friends if I go out. So wine has always been a kind of a family tradition with supper. So-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So it was kind of been a part of your culture a little bit, and you know, just find alcohol, maybe takes the edge off a little bit and-
Client: Yeah, and I, you know, I-I have friends who have drank during pregnancy, and-and I see articles on Facebook and-and, you know, things that show that there isn't really a clear link between, you know, abnormalities or, uh, yeah, I just- I just think it's kind of an old wives' tale. So, you know, I'm independent and I'm gonna- I'm gonna do what I want, it's my body.
Therapist: Okay. So you don't feel very comfortable with somebody telling you what you should be consuming, what kind of alcohol, and how much alcohol you should be consuming. And, um, it sounds like you've been getting some mixed messages, your doctor's saying there's no safe amount of alcohol you can drink, and asked you to come and see me. And then also, you've been checking- sounds like you've been checking things out a little bit.
Client: Yeah. You know, I've looked it up to see, you know, kinda what I can say back, you know, to support my argument.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Yeah, which is that, um, I'm going to do what I- do what I wanna do and what I know, right? So it's- yeah. I don't know, but, um, I'm here anyway. So-
Therapist: So you know yourself best and you wanna be sort of the boss of your body and you don't want somebody else telling you what- what's okay and what's not okay. And it seems like you're not maybe too concerned right now about your substance use.
Client: Nope. I never have been.
Therapist: Okay. And I'm wondering if that concern is coming from, ""It's been okay. I've got these messages from friends.""
Client: Yep.
Therapist: ""Um, media has said it's okay to drink during alcohol. And so that concern, um, just sort of, I don't have it and, and maybe the doctor might be wrong.""
Client: Mm-hmm. I think so.
Therapist: You're not sure if he's sort of playing things up a little bit there?
Client: Yeah. I mean, you know-
Therapist: It might be a bit extreme to-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -to quit drinking. Um, I'm just wondering, have you, um, would you be open maybe to just kind of taking a look at what Canada's guidelines say about drinking? Um, is that something you'd be open to?
Client: Like right now?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Uh-
Therapist: What if- uh, can I show you a brochure about that?
Client: Uh, yeah, I guess.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Sure.
Therapist: Well, if we take a look at the low-risk-alcohol drinking guidelines, what it says is for women, um, the safe limits are 10 drinks a week for women and 2 drinks a day. And that's if a woman isn't pregnant. And when it says in the guidelines, as far as drinking, uh, throughout pregnancy, there is no safe amount to drink during pregnancy. So really zero alcohol is, um, the woman should not be drinking any at all. And I'm just wondering what-what are your thoughts on that?
Client: Well, you know, I've-I've heard these kinds of things before, but I just- I don't see the evidence. I don't see the risk, you know, I don't, you know, if someone can like prove to me, or show a direct link or something like that.
Therapist: So when you see it here in kind of black and white, you're not sure if this is, uh, you know, enough-
Client: It's the same thing.
Therapist: -to con- sort of convince you that-that it might be dangerous to be drinking through alcohol?
Client: Yeah. It's just a fancy little brochure saying what I've already known, I've already heard.
Therapist: So you feel like, um, what the doctor's saying and this brochure just kind of feels like, yeah, it's just kind of blowing things up out of proportion a little bit.
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: And it sounds like you-you've got some solid information already that alcohol, you know, has been safe to-to have during pregnancy. Tell me about that information that you've-you've explored.
Client: Um, well, I've looked up, um, different articles. Um, and I- as I said, I personally know people who haven't had any problems. Um, so that's about the extent.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. You mentioned you looked up some articles and it sounds like evidence is really important to you. So, um, those articles, is that something recent? Um, you can tell me about that.
Client: Like, uh, I don't like- have like a bibliography or anything.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: So I can't really- I don't really know when those were published. It's just stuff I've found, supporting the way that I look at it.
Therapist: So you felt like, um, the information that you found supports the values that you have of being able to be independent and autonomous, to be able to make your own choice and the information that your doctor shared or spoke to you about, and then this brochure kind of feels like that's challenging sort of your values.
Client: Yeah. Well, it's like all this brochure is saying is that, um, the same again, the same thing that I've heard, that the limits and that there is no safe amount of drink during pregnancy, but it's like, why not?
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: You know, it's kind of like the ""why"" that it's like-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -I never get that information.
Therapist: Wha-what's the big deal if you're drinking and—
Client: Yeah, like what kind of issues would that cause if any?
Therapist: Maybe we can kind of put that on the shelf for a moment, and we'll come back to it and sort of look at, you know, what is- what does the guidelines have to say about why. And, um, and-and I'm wondering if we can kind of just have a look for a moment at, um, your pregnancy, and is this something that you were- you were hoping to have a baby?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: That was something that you'd been planning?
Client: Yep.
Therapist: Okay. And I'm wondering as far as, um, bringing the baby into the world and, you know, your future as a parent, ho-how important is it to have a healthy baby to you?

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: Uh, welcome. And, uh—
Client: Thank you.
Therapist: I'd say my name is Mark and I work here at Green Prescriptions. And-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: I know a little bit about you from the referral letter from the doctor.
Client: From my GP?
Therapist: From your GP, yeah.
Client: Uh.
Therapist: But before we get to anything, I'll probably want to just ask you a little bit about what's led you to come here today and get a bit of an idea about what's been going on for you.
Client: What's led me to come here?
Therapist: Mm.
Client: My GP.
Therapist: And what did he have to say?
Client: Well, um, you know, I had my sort of, uh, checkup.
Therapist: mm.
Client: And it revealed that apparently, I might have diabetes 2. Well, that's what he says.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Um, I-I think that I feel perfectly well. I-I'm, you know-- I understand people with diabetes are a little bit plumper than I am.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: But, um, that's really why I'm here. I'm on his command, almost.
Therapist: Right, so he kinda gave you a directive?
Client: Well, he did. He says he's going to put me on some sort of program if it gets worse.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: But as I say, I-I feel absolutely fine now.
Therapist: So it kind of came a bit of a surprise, you feeling okay.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: You go for this checkup with the doctor. And he says, ""You've got Type II diabetes.""
Client: Mm, I'm very surprised.
Therapist: Mm. Came out of the blue for you?
Client: Yes. I think it did.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: And you said you kind of don't fit that kinda Type II diabetes look. That you kinda have had this idea-
Client: I-
Therapist: -you've been-been overweight with it.
Client: That's what I understand.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: You know, and I'm not overweight.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I-I sort of look after myself to a limited extent in that way. Um, but I'm a busy person, I suppose I burn off the calories. And-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I don't know, really.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: My lifestyle—
Therapist: Hmm. So it doesn't quite fit in your head, Type II diabetes and-
Client: No.
Therapist: -your lifestyle?
Client: No, not at all.
Therapist: Comes as a big surprise. And what was your reaction when he told you that at the time?
Client: Well, I-I thought he must be joking. To be honest. I thought-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -you know, why you are-- Look around you.
Therapist: Mm, mm.
Client: um, I just felt that, um-- I mean, I don't think he was wasting my time because why would he do that?
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: Right?
Therapist: He's got a lot to do.
Client: Um-- Absolutely right.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: He's got a job to do. And obviously, the tests have come through. And I have got these signs of diabetes 2.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Right? Um, I just think that-- Well, I just don't feel like it, Mark.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Um—
Therapist: So how are you feel in your head-
Client: I feel absolutely fine.
Therapist: -and what the tests say kind of like don't join up.
Client: Yeah. Well, physically, I feel absolutely fine.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I'm-I'm-- I didn't see anything wrong with me at all.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: I mean, I get around, I sleep pretty well-
Therapist: Hmm-hmm.
Client: I sort of you know-
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: - I'm-I'm compos mentis. So I don't—
Therapist: Yeah. What's the problem? Mm.
Client: What is the problem?
Therapist: And how did this happen is probably kind of what you're also thinking. Well, how did this--?
Client: Well, uh, yes. I mean-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -I must admit, I haven't done too much research. I've been a bit busy.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Um, but he-he was saying something about, I don't know, family or whatever. I don't know.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And I don't know if it's hereditary.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I think he said something about it being hereditary.
Therapist: So he mentioned, it might be a family thing. And so you-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -maybe got from your parents or something of the sort.
Client: Yeah, it could be-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -because, um, my mother mentioned-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -that, uh, my father had diabetes-
Therapist: Right.
Client: -diabetes 2. And if I think about it, um, his brother-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -uh, I haven't seen him for years.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But he might well have it because he is-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -a pretty cuddly guy. You know-
Therapist: Right.
Client: He's pretty big.
Therapist: So he fits the picture-
Client: Well, yes, the stereotype,-
Therapist: -when you think about what he-he-- Yeah, he's stereotypical.
Client: Yeah, I guess.
Therapist: A little bit bigger, perhaps doesn't look after himself that well, and he fits that foot
Client: Well, yeah. I mean, as far as I know, I hadn't seen him for-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -I don't know how many years.
Therapist: Mm. So you got this knowledge as a witness there's some family history of diabetes in the past?
Client: Apparently so. Yes, apparently so.
Therapist: Doctor mentioned that as being a factor.
Client: Mm, I mean, it is hereditary, is it?
Therapist: That's certainly true. Yes. We know that people who've had parents or have been in the past, there is a hereditary factor or genetic factor in-involved.
Client: A genetic factor. And so, does that mean that if you've got, um, if you've got a history of this within your family-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -if it's a gene-- you are more likely than not to get it?
Therapist: Correct. Yeah.
Client: Also, it's—
Therapist: But it's not inevitable.
Client: Right. Okay.
Therapist: Because its genes or the-the-the-the hereditary factor is not the only factor that causes it or is involved in it happening to you. So there's other factors that come into play.
Client: I'm sure you're going to tell me what they are.
Therapist: Well, you've-you've mentioned some of the things you know, and one of those is hereditary factors. You mentioned that the doctor mentioned that. And what else do you know or have you heard? You say you haven't had a lot of time to do the research. What else? Other things you've.
Client: To be frank, Mark, I honestly don't know. I mean, I honestly don't know what causes it because I've never had any reason. It came upon me from the GP and it took me back.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, the hereditary thing I thought, well, maybe that's the explanation.
Therapist: That makes a bit of sense.
Client: And why go any further, it's there?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Can't help it.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: They live pretty long lives, they did, all right.
Therapist: They managed with it.
Client: Relatives relatively went into their 70s.
Therapist: Okay. I don't know if it'd be helpful for you if you'd like to know a little bit more about some of the factors involved in time Type II diabetes.
Client: Well.
Therapist: If that would help.
Client: If there's something that you think that-- Yes. Yes, of course.
Therapist: Well, I'll perhaps share with you what I know from working with other people and some of the things I've experienced in working with people.
Client: Okay.
Therapist: And see what you make of it. See if it fits a little bit more with where you're at. We know that there is a strong family factor or hereditary factor, so that's one aspect. So also it tends to happen a little bit later in life, rather than something you might get when you're a teenager, this type of diabetes. So-so it's a later onset. It takes a bit of time for it to develop maybe. And the main reason I think, um, the main aspect of it is that it, have you heard about insulin.
Client: I've heard of it yeah.
Therapist: So that's a hormone or a chemical, it allows you to utilize sugar in your body.
Client: Right.
Therapist: All right. And Type II diabetes typically people have a resistance or a resistance to insulin in their cells, in their fat cells or their muscle cells or liver cells. They can't use insulin. And so sugar builds up in your system.
Client: Are you saying that they-they like they can't digest insulin or is that?
Therapist: You need insulin in your cells, individual cells in muscle or in fat or wherever to, um, use up excess sugar or to utilize sugar.
Client: Oh, I see. So-so it's like a-it's like a balance.
Therapist: That's right.
Client: So insulin you-you.
Therapist: Kind of, as your.
Client: You have yourself draws bar.
Therapist: Yap.
Client: Or something, and then what balances that out in the body is the insulin taking off the excess.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Or-or digesting? Should I say the excessive sugars?
Therapist: That's a good way to think.
Client: Is that what happened?
Therapist: Exactly. And what's happening in Type II diabetes is your-your fat cells and liver cells and muscle cells are resistant to insulin. It's almost like they're saying we can't use that.
Client: Why?
Therapist: And if-- Well, there's a number of-- We're not entirely sure, there's a lot of research still going on as to how this happens and how that could be modified. But what we do know is that, um, one of the key things in managing it is to try and modify or modulate, control the amount of sugar that are in your system.
Client: Right. Okay.
Therapist: Yeah. So there's a couple of things that we know that people with Type II diabetes have to look after and have to think about if they want to control the amount of sugar that's in their system, which is the main issue that's causing some of the health problems that people have with Type II diabetes. Too much sugar, and if it's not able to be utilized in the blood cell, in the fat cells, or liver cells, and the muscle cells stays in your bloodstream. And that can cause problems with your circulation. So too high blood sugar and too low a blood sugar can be a problem. So sugar is the main concern in Type II- Type II diabetes.And you mentioned earlier on, a couple of things that the doctor-- You've mentioned some signs that he was kind of a little bit concerned about. Well, what things did you notice over the-over the last month or so?
Client: You mean, personally?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Well, I didn't know. I mean, the thing is you see that-- I mean, I did think about this a little bit and I thought, well, over time, if things happen slowly, you don't really notice.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: As you get older.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I don't-I don't leap over five bar gates like I used to, you know, um, as opposed to, uh, running with the backs now, I tend to spend more time, you know, with my old mates in the bar.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: At the rugby club and-and-and the such like, yeah. And, um, the fish I'm hooking, I'm not after the kings anymore, I go for the snapper now, it's a bit easier, you know.
Therapist: A slightly more sedate lifestyle.
Client: Yeah, absolutely. You just do.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: You just do. Um, so you're less demanding, I guess, on your-on your body, you realize, and you don't really want to do these things anyway. You know, you let the youngsters get home.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Been there, done that. So you don't really notice. So I'm coming back to this diagnosis I had from my GP and him saying, ""You've got diabetes 2,"" well, I should feel like that, shouldn't I?
Therapist: Yeah. It should feel like there's something really wrong with you.
Client: Yeah, I mean.
Therapist: What's-how have you been feeling over the last month? So, you say you're very busy you're doing a lot of work.
Client: Yeah, I mean I'm a busy person. All right? I uh, my work uh, I work in insurance, so I'm always hopping from one place to another place.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, I haven't noticed.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: I really haven't noticed how, um, okay I get a bit--I suppose I get a bit out of breath sometimes.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: If I rush too much that-that's true. Um, I suppose, um, I don't go upstairs two at a time anymore, I use one at a time.
Therapist: So a little bit sort of energy is not quite there sometimes? The vitality.
Client: Oh, certainly the energy I have is-is not what I-what I had. I mean I do need to, you know, I'm busy but I do need to sit down, um, uh, I do need to sit down and relax with a cup of coffee, you know, and, uh, things.
Therapist: Yeah, Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, more than I would normally.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But that would be, that would be about it.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, is it getting worse? I don't know. I-I-I suppose. What worse? Is it-is it increasing? Well, to say, I don't really notice it.
Therapist: You haven't noticed it. So it's a progressive, you know, you've just seen this, as-as you got older, things have slowed down. You know those activities you used to do, but that's kind of like what happens.
Client: Yeah, yeah. Um, at least, that's what I think. I mean I don't know if you're telling me that I should be more active or my GP is saying I should be more active.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, as I say, uh, you know I-I don't do any regular form of exercise, I have to say, not anymore.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: But maybe I-maybe I don't know.
Therapist: Hmm, a bit of a mystery there.
Client: I mean I've got uh, well I-I mean I've got a great lifestyle. I mean if it's very-it-it's very good. I mean I've got all my mates in down at the rugby club. And I've got uh, you know even in the summer when that's a bit damn. I used to coach rugby and I coached cricket when I finished playing. So-so I've got the-the guys in the cricket club, um, you know, for the-for the, uh, for the summer evenings. And, uh, and then, uh, the-then, of course, we've got the fishing, and that's all of us combined. We're a big gang, really.
Therapist: Really? So what I'm hearing is there's actually a lot of aspects in your life which are really good.
Client: Oh, I think my life yeah. My life is great.
Therapist: From your perspective, things are going well?
Client: My life is great, and then you turn around and say, ""Hey you've got-- you-you're ill, you're sick.
Therapist: Yeah. It doesn't fit.
Client: And um, no I'm not. But you see, he said to me that he's gonna put me on some sort of, uh, a daily monitoring of, is it sugar levels?
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: And I'm gonna have to take regular pills.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Well frankly, the only pills I take are sort of paracetamols.
Therapist: Yeah. When you get uh, a headache.
Client: For a bit of the head in the morning, you know.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um.
Therapist: So the idea of having to test-test your blood sugar and take medications is kinda like off--
Client: Come on, you know.
Therapist: And you know that's a bit too-
Client: Well, life is too short.
Therapist: Too much.
Client: You know it's the truth.
Therapist: Yeah. Okay.
Client: I mean you know—
Therapist: And you're here today and that's probably something in you you've thought well I'll follow this through, you know I'll-I'll come along and see what-see what they've got to say. And I'm just wondering for this session, for the time we have today, there's a number of things we could talk about. You mentioned a couple of things about your lifestyle and, um, medication is one thing you've been told by the doctor you might need to do that. And a number of things that we could talk about today. Which-which area would you think would be useful for you to focus on?
Client: Well there is-there is something that you sort of prompted me to think about, and, um, I split up-- My wife and I, we split up several years ago now. And, um, you know we've been married for many many years.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: And um, I think she used to look after me because she used to do the cooking and-and-and stuff like that.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And I have to say that I'm not the best cook in the world.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, and-and being on the run all the time and you know once I get back home, it's, you know, it's time to go down to the rugby club or whatever it might be, uh, we're out with the mates. And, uh, I-I do I suppose my food is not as healthy perhaps as it used to be when she was around. She's moved down to Hamilton to live with her mother, if you've met her mother. Anyway, but, um.
Therapist: So then, since you've been on your own since you've separated, divorced and you've noticed that the things you eat and how you eat has changed.
Client: Yeah, I mean mates and their wives are pretty cool about it sometimes.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Because, you know, they'll invite me for dinner and so on.
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: And, yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess, you know, that's when you, well, or whatever reason, you split up in life.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You start looking at the home life of somebody else, you're thinking, ""Hmm, I use d to have this.""
Therapist: Hmm. Yeah, yeah.
Client: And you think, "" This is nice food, "" isn't it? and you know.
Therapist: Yeah. And your-- part of your wife used to do a lot of that for you?
Client: Oh, she would do all the cooking. Yeah, yeah,
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I never bothered to boil an egg in the water, you know.
Therapist: And so she would kinda look after what you ate and healthy things that you had, spread in front of you and off you go.
Client: Totally. I mean, I was just in charge of the wine, you know.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. And now you have to think about what you might eat and sometimes you don't eat the best.
Client: Well I-- This is what I'm saying. Maybe I'm not thinking about it. Maybe that's the thing.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Maybe I'm just—
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You know, because it-- you know this-- the pizza shop's just on the road.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And then there's-- I mean, okay, I confess that lunchtime, occasionally, it's uh, I'm hungry and McDonald's is very convenient
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -or Kentucky Fried or whatever.
Therapist: Very appealing, isn't it?
Client: You know, it's very easy. and then, um, then you think to yourself, well-- I mean, I do think of myself that maybe I should have a few vegetables around here or whatever. But then you go out into the supermarkets, you know, and you can pick up, uh, your- one of your TV dinners.
Therapist: Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm.
Client: So you bring those in and you open them up and put them in the microwave and there's vegetables there.
Therapist: Yeah they look pretty good on the plate, don't they?
Client: Yeah, it looks- it looks fine, you know, et cetera. I mean, so that will happen occasionally if I've got a night in. But cooking-wise, no, I haven't cooked anything, um, other than boil the water for the kettle for a cup o coffee.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -for ages.
Therapist: They're food choices in what you eat and what's in your diet it's not what-something you actually you've actually been aware of or had to think about in the past.
Client: Yeah. I do miss her breakfast. I have to say, we used to have get a nice breakfast.
Therapist: So one thing that you noticed is diet and the eating patterns and-
Client: Well—
Therapist: -when you eat. That's one aspect. What other aspects do you think you've-- you would be--?
Client: Well, I used to be quite a heavy smoker, right? I mean, I'd smoke a pack in a half a day. And I knew that wasn't doing me any good.
Therapist: Right.
Client: I mean the thing is when you're a-- I mean, I've always smoked. So, but when you're young and you're a sportsman, you know—
Therapist: You kinda juggle those two things and kinda--
Client: Well, the two things they balance out, you know and everybody else is
Therapist: You still run and have a cigarette?
Client: You know, you pass a cigarette down the backline almost, don't you? You know, just before the game gets—
Therapist: Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, part of the culture.
Client: Yeah, part of the of the whole thing. And it's changed a bit now, because in my day when we were playing, of course, it was a very much more of a social game, which was spent-spent in the rugby club.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: That's why you played and it was a big buddy-buddy thing.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: That was rugby and cricket was the same really.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Um, but now—
Therapist: But over the years, you've actually reduced your smoking or you've stopped altogether or at times?
Client: Well I-I, yeah. I was getting a bit sort of-- I was getting a bit, you know, a bit wheezy and I thought, ""I'll cut this out.""
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: But I enjoy smoking. I really do enjoy it. So I cut it down to I suppose it's about 10 a day now.
Therapist: Okay, so you meant to reduce.

Return ""simple"", ""complex"" or ""none"" based on whether the last therapist's utterance  has a simple, complex or no reflection. 
Feel free to return none as the therapist utterance might not have any reflection.

Here are a few examples.

Examples:

Example 1
Client: But-but the wheezing is something that I've definitely noticed a little bit.
Therapist: I guess I also wonder whether, regardless of-of if your asthma symptoms are connected to Oscar, that may be part of you feels like it's worth it because he's been-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: -such a big part of your life for so long.
Answer: complex

Example 2
Client: Um, I'm just- yeah I just like to have a few drinks. I mean, you know, obviously, I-I have, uh, this diagnosed condition, and-and I think, you know, if I were able to, you know, maybe take a few hits off of the joint and have a couple of beers, I think that's about the same as taking the medicine.
Therapist: Well, you know, what, I-- There are a lot of people that wouldn't disagree with you on that exactly. You know, so, um, uh, but I know that they-they were never quite sure how they were all interacting all together. Like the, um- the weed kind of tends to make people a little paranoid anyway.
Client: Yeah, I-I-I got to be careful with it. If I take more than a hit or two of it, it-it-it can be a bit of a problem.
Therapist: Yeah. Why, what happens if you take a little too much of it?
Answer: none

Example 3
Client: That's a good way to sum it up. And it's-- Well, you understand it, uh, it's just- it's not good.
Therapist: Mm. So, and then you said, you don't like how it makes you act, um, if you can tell me a little bit about that.
Answer: simple

Example 4
Client: Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know.
Therapist: But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?
Answer: complex

Example 5
Client: I wanna stay friends with them. I don't want- I don't want them to just-
Therapist: You don't wanna lose your support group, yeah. You just wanna them to support you in being healthy, while helping them, raising the babe, and so we're just taking path B. You don't wanna lose them, just maybe the lifestyle it sounds like.
Answer: none

Example 6
Client: Um, I mean, I guess- I guess I need some strategies for figuring out how to ease stress without, I guess, getting high.
Therapist: Okay. And that's a very good reason for being here. Um, can you talk to me about maybe some of your-- the goals that you have?
Answer: none

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: Uh, welcome. And, uh—
Client: Thank you.
Therapist: I'd say my name is Mark and I work here at Green Prescriptions. And-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: I know a little bit about you from the referral letter from the doctor.
Client: From my GP?
Therapist: From your GP, yeah.
Client: Uh.
Therapist: But before we get to anything, I'll probably want to just ask you a little bit about what's led you to come here today and get a bit of an idea about what's been going on for you.
Client: What's led me to come here?
Therapist: Mm.
Client: My GP.
Therapist: And what did he have to say?
Client: Well, um, you know, I had my sort of, uh, checkup.
Therapist: mm.
Client: And it revealed that apparently, I might have diabetes 2. Well, that's what he says.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Um, I-I think that I feel perfectly well. I-I'm, you know-- I understand people with diabetes are a little bit plumper than I am.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: But, um, that's really why I'm here. I'm on his command, almost.
Therapist: Right, so he kinda gave you a directive?
Client: Well, he did. He says he's going to put me on some sort of program if it gets worse.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: But as I say, I-I feel absolutely fine now.
Therapist: So it kind of came a bit of a surprise, you feeling okay.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: You go for this checkup with the doctor. And he says, ""You've got Type II diabetes.""
Client: Mm, I'm very surprised.
Therapist: Mm. Came out of the blue for you?
Client: Yes. I think it did.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: And you said you kind of don't fit that kinda Type II diabetes look. That you kinda have had this idea-
Client: I-
Therapist: -you've been-been overweight with it.
Client: That's what I understand.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: You know, and I'm not overweight.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I-I sort of look after myself to a limited extent in that way. Um, but I'm a busy person, I suppose I burn off the calories. And-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I don't know, really.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: My lifestyle—
Therapist: Hmm. So it doesn't quite fit in your head, Type II diabetes and-
Client: No.
Therapist: -your lifestyle?
Client: No, not at all.
Therapist: Comes as a big surprise. And what was your reaction when he told you that at the time?
Client: Well, I-I thought he must be joking. To be honest. I thought-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -you know, why you are-- Look around you.
Therapist: Mm, mm.
Client: um, I just felt that, um-- I mean, I don't think he was wasting my time because why would he do that?
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: Right?
Therapist: He's got a lot to do.
Client: Um-- Absolutely right.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: He's got a job to do. And obviously, the tests have come through. And I have got these signs of diabetes 2.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Right? Um, I just think that-- Well, I just don't feel like it, Mark.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Um—
Therapist: So how are you feel in your head-
Client: I feel absolutely fine.
Therapist: -and what the tests say kind of like don't join up.
Client: Yeah. Well, physically, I feel absolutely fine.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I'm-I'm-- I didn't see anything wrong with me at all.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: I mean, I get around, I sleep pretty well-
Therapist: Hmm-hmm.
Client: I sort of you know-
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: - I'm-I'm compos mentis. So I don't—
Therapist: Yeah. What's the problem? Mm.
Client: What is the problem?
Therapist: And how did this happen is probably kind of what you're also thinking. Well, how did this--?
Client: Well, uh, yes. I mean-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -I must admit, I haven't done too much research. I've been a bit busy.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Um, but he-he was saying something about, I don't know, family or whatever. I don't know.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And I don't know if it's hereditary.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I think he said something about it being hereditary.
Therapist: So he mentioned, it might be a family thing. And so you-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -maybe got from your parents or something of the sort.
Client: Yeah, it could be-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -because, um, my mother mentioned-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -that, uh, my father had diabetes-
Therapist: Right.
Client: -diabetes 2. And if I think about it, um, his brother-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -uh, I haven't seen him for years.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But he might well have it because he is-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -a pretty cuddly guy. You know-
Therapist: Right.
Client: He's pretty big.
Therapist: So he fits the picture-
Client: Well, yes, the stereotype,-
Therapist: -when you think about what he-he-- Yeah, he's stereotypical.
Client: Yeah, I guess.
Therapist: A little bit bigger, perhaps doesn't look after himself that well, and he fits that foot
Client: Well, yeah. I mean, as far as I know, I hadn't seen him for-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -I don't know how many years.
Therapist: Mm. So you got this knowledge as a witness there's some family history of diabetes in the past?
Client: Apparently so. Yes, apparently so.
Therapist: Doctor mentioned that as being a factor.
Client: Mm, I mean, it is hereditary, is it?
Therapist: That's certainly true. Yes. We know that people who've had parents or have been in the past, there is a hereditary factor or genetic factor in-involved.
Client: A genetic factor. And so, does that mean that if you've got, um, if you've got a history of this within your family-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -if it's a gene-- you are more likely than not to get it?
Therapist: Correct. Yeah.
Client: Also, it's—
Therapist: But it's not inevitable.
Client: Right. Okay.
Therapist: Because its genes or the-the-the-the hereditary factor is not the only factor that causes it or is involved in it happening to you. So there's other factors that come into play.
Client: I'm sure you're going to tell me what they are.
Therapist: Well, you've-you've mentioned some of the things you know, and one of those is hereditary factors. You mentioned that the doctor mentioned that. And what else do you know or have you heard? You say you haven't had a lot of time to do the research. What else? Other things you've.
Client: To be frank, Mark, I honestly don't know. I mean, I honestly don't know what causes it because I've never had any reason. It came upon me from the GP and it took me back.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, the hereditary thing I thought, well, maybe that's the explanation.
Therapist: That makes a bit of sense.
Client: And why go any further, it's there?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Can't help it.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: They live pretty long lives, they did, all right.
Therapist: They managed with it.
Client: Relatives relatively went into their 70s.
Therapist: Okay. I don't know if it'd be helpful for you if you'd like to know a little bit more about some of the factors involved in time Type II diabetes.
Client: Well.
Therapist: If that would help.
Client: If there's something that you think that-- Yes. Yes, of course.
Therapist: Well, I'll perhaps share with you what I know from working with other people and some of the things I've experienced in working with people.
Client: Okay.
Therapist: And see what you make of it. See if it fits a little bit more with where you're at. We know that there is a strong family factor or hereditary factor, so that's one aspect. So also it tends to happen a little bit later in life, rather than something you might get when you're a teenager, this type of diabetes. So-so it's a later onset. It takes a bit of time for it to develop maybe. And the main reason I think, um, the main aspect of it is that it, have you heard about insulin.
Client: I've heard of it yeah.
Therapist: So that's a hormone or a chemical, it allows you to utilize sugar in your body.
Client: Right.
Therapist: All right. And Type II diabetes typically people have a resistance or a resistance to insulin in their cells, in their fat cells or their muscle cells or liver cells. They can't use insulin. And so sugar builds up in your system.
Client: Are you saying that they-they like they can't digest insulin or is that?
Therapist: You need insulin in your cells, individual cells in muscle or in fat or wherever to, um, use up excess sugar or to utilize sugar.
Client: Oh, I see. So-so it's like a-it's like a balance.
Therapist: That's right.
Client: So insulin you-you.
Therapist: Kind of, as your.
Client: You have yourself draws bar.
Therapist: Yap.
Client: Or something, and then what balances that out in the body is the insulin taking off the excess.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Or-or digesting? Should I say the excessive sugars?
Therapist: That's a good way to think.
Client: Is that what happened?
Therapist: Exactly. And what's happening in Type II diabetes is your-your fat cells and liver cells and muscle cells are resistant to insulin. It's almost like they're saying we can't use that.
Client: Why?
Therapist: And if-- Well, there's a number of-- We're not entirely sure, there's a lot of research still going on as to how this happens and how that could be modified. But what we do know is that, um, one of the key things in managing it is to try and modify or modulate, control the amount of sugar that are in your system.
Client: Right. Okay.
Therapist: Yeah. So there's a couple of things that we know that people with Type II diabetes have to look after and have to think about if they want to control the amount of sugar that's in their system, which is the main issue that's causing some of the health problems that people have with Type II diabetes. Too much sugar, and if it's not able to be utilized in the blood cell, in the fat cells, or liver cells, and the muscle cells stays in your bloodstream. And that can cause problems with your circulation. So too high blood sugar and too low a blood sugar can be a problem. So sugar is the main concern in Type II- Type II diabetes.And you mentioned earlier on, a couple of things that the doctor-- You've mentioned some signs that he was kind of a little bit concerned about. Well, what things did you notice over the-over the last month or so?
Client: You mean, personally?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Well, I didn't know. I mean, the thing is you see that-- I mean, I did think about this a little bit and I thought, well, over time, if things happen slowly, you don't really notice.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: As you get older.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I don't-I don't leap over five bar gates like I used to, you know, um, as opposed to, uh, running with the backs now, I tend to spend more time, you know, with my old mates in the bar.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: At the rugby club and-and-and the such like, yeah. And, um, the fish I'm hooking, I'm not after the kings anymore, I go for the snapper now, it's a bit easier, you know.
Therapist: A slightly more sedate lifestyle.
Client: Yeah, absolutely. You just do.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: You just do. Um, so you're less demanding, I guess, on your-on your body, you realize, and you don't really want to do these things anyway. You know, you let the youngsters get home.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Been there, done that. So you don't really notice. So I'm coming back to this diagnosis I had from my GP and him saying, ""You've got diabetes 2,"" well, I should feel like that, shouldn't I?
Therapist: Yeah. It should feel like there's something really wrong with you.
Client: Yeah, I mean.
Therapist: What's-how have you been feeling over the last month? So, you say you're very busy you're doing a lot of work.
Client: Yeah, I mean I'm a busy person. All right? I uh, my work uh, I work in insurance, so I'm always hopping from one place to another place.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, I haven't noticed.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: I really haven't noticed how, um, okay I get a bit--I suppose I get a bit out of breath sometimes.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: If I rush too much that-that's true. Um, I suppose, um, I don't go upstairs two at a time anymore, I use one at a time.
Therapist: So a little bit sort of energy is not quite there sometimes? The vitality.
Client: Oh, certainly the energy I have is-is not what I-what I had. I mean I do need to, you know, I'm busy but I do need to sit down, um, uh, I do need to sit down and relax with a cup of coffee, you know, and, uh, things.
Therapist: Yeah, Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, more than I would normally.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But that would be, that would be about it.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, is it getting worse? I don't know. I-I-I suppose. What worse? Is it-is it increasing? Well, to say, I don't really notice it.
Therapist: You haven't noticed it. So it's a progressive, you know, you've just seen this, as-as you got older, things have slowed down. You know those activities you used to do, but that's kind of like what happens.
Client: Yeah, yeah. Um, at least, that's what I think. I mean I don't know if you're telling me that I should be more active or my GP is saying I should be more active.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, as I say, uh, you know I-I don't do any regular form of exercise, I have to say, not anymore.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: But maybe I-maybe I don't know.
Therapist: Hmm, a bit of a mystery there.
Client: I mean I've got uh, well I-I mean I've got a great lifestyle. I mean if it's very-it-it's very good. I mean I've got all my mates in down at the rugby club. And I've got uh, you know even in the summer when that's a bit damn. I used to coach rugby and I coached cricket when I finished playing. So-so I've got the-the guys in the cricket club, um, you know, for the-for the, uh, for the summer evenings. And, uh, and then, uh, the-then, of course, we've got the fishing, and that's all of us combined. We're a big gang, really.
Therapist: Really? So what I'm hearing is there's actually a lot of aspects in your life which are really good.
Client: Oh, I think my life yeah. My life is great.
Therapist: From your perspective, things are going well?
Client: My life is great, and then you turn around and say, ""Hey you've got-- you-you're ill, you're sick.
Therapist: Yeah. It doesn't fit.
Client: And um, no I'm not. But you see, he said to me that he's gonna put me on some sort of, uh, a daily monitoring of, is it sugar levels?
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: And I'm gonna have to take regular pills.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Well frankly, the only pills I take are sort of paracetamols.
Therapist: Yeah. When you get uh, a headache.
Client: For a bit of the head in the morning, you know.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um.
Therapist: So the idea of having to test-test your blood sugar and take medications is kinda like off--
Client: Come on, you know.
Therapist: And you know that's a bit too-
Client: Well, life is too short.
Therapist: Too much.
Client: You know it's the truth.
Therapist: Yeah. Okay.
Client: I mean you know—
Therapist: And you're here today and that's probably something in you you've thought well I'll follow this through, you know I'll-I'll come along and see what-see what they've got to say. And I'm just wondering for this session, for the time we have today, there's a number of things we could talk about. You mentioned a couple of things about your lifestyle and, um, medication is one thing you've been told by the doctor you might need to do that. And a number of things that we could talk about today. Which-which area would you think would be useful for you to focus on?
Client: Well there is-there is something that you sort of prompted me to think about, and, um, I split up-- My wife and I, we split up several years ago now. And, um, you know we've been married for many many years.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: And um, I think she used to look after me because she used to do the cooking and-and-and stuff like that.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And I have to say that I'm not the best cook in the world.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, and-and being on the run all the time and you know once I get back home, it's, you know, it's time to go down to the rugby club or whatever it might be, uh, we're out with the mates. And, uh, I-I do I suppose my food is not as healthy perhaps as it used to be when she was around. She's moved down to Hamilton to live with her mother, if you've met her mother. Anyway, but, um.
Therapist: So then, since you've been on your own since you've separated, divorced and you've noticed that the things you eat and how you eat has changed.
Client: Yeah, I mean mates and their wives are pretty cool about it sometimes.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Because, you know, they'll invite me for dinner and so on.
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: And, yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess, you know, that's when you, well, or whatever reason, you split up in life.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You start looking at the home life of somebody else, you're thinking, ""Hmm, I use d to have this.""
Therapist: Hmm. Yeah, yeah.
Client: And you think, "" This is nice food, "" isn't it? and you know.
Therapist: Yeah. And your-- part of your wife used to do a lot of that for you?
Client: Oh, she would do all the cooking. Yeah, yeah,
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I never bothered to boil an egg in the water, you know.
Therapist: And so she would kinda look after what you ate and healthy things that you had, spread in front of you and off you go.
Client: Totally. I mean, I was just in charge of the wine, you know.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. And now you have to think about what you might eat and sometimes you don't eat the best.
Client: Well I-- This is what I'm saying. Maybe I'm not thinking about it. Maybe that's the thing.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Maybe I'm just—
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You know, because it-- you know this-- the pizza shop's just on the road.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And then there's-- I mean, okay, I confess that lunchtime, occasionally, it's uh, I'm hungry and McDonald's is very convenient
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -or Kentucky Fried or whatever.
Therapist: Very appealing, isn't it?
Client: You know, it's very easy. and then, um, then you think to yourself, well-- I mean, I do think of myself that maybe I should have a few vegetables around here or whatever. But then you go out into the supermarkets, you know, and you can pick up, uh, your- one of your TV dinners.
Therapist: Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm.
Client: So you bring those in and you open them up and put them in the microwave and there's vegetables there.
Therapist: Yeah they look pretty good on the plate, don't they?
Client: Yeah, it looks- it looks fine, you know, et cetera. I mean, so that will happen occasionally if I've got a night in. But cooking-wise, no, I haven't cooked anything, um, other than boil the water for the kettle for a cup o coffee.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -for ages.
Therapist: They're food choices in what you eat and what's in your diet it's not what-something you actually you've actually been aware of or had to think about in the past.
Client: Yeah. I do miss her breakfast. I have to say, we used to have get a nice breakfast.
Therapist: So one thing that you noticed is diet and the eating patterns and-
Client: Well—
Therapist: -when you eat. That's one aspect. What other aspects do you think you've-- you would be--?
Client: Well, I used to be quite a heavy smoker, right? I mean, I'd smoke a pack in a half a day. And I knew that wasn't doing me any good.
Therapist: Right.
Client: I mean the thing is when you're a-- I mean, I've always smoked. So, but when you're young and you're a sportsman, you know—
Therapist: You kinda juggle those two things and kinda--
Client: Well, the two things they balance out, you know and everybody else is
Therapist: You still run and have a cigarette?
Client: You know, you pass a cigarette down the backline almost, don't you? You know, just before the game gets—
Therapist: Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, part of the culture.
Client: Yeah, part of the of the whole thing. And it's changed a bit now, because in my day when we were playing, of course, it was a very much more of a social game, which was spent-spent in the rugby club.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: That's why you played and it was a big buddy-buddy thing.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: That was rugby and cricket was the same really.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Um, but now—
Therapist: But over the years, you've actually reduced your smoking or you've stopped altogether or at times?
Client: Well I-I, yeah. I was getting a bit sort of-- I was getting a bit, you know, a bit wheezy and I thought, ""I'll cut this out.""
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: But I enjoy smoking. I really do enjoy it. So I cut it down to I suppose it's about 10 a day now.
Therapist: Okay, so you meant to reduce.
Client: Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: You were noticing that it's having an impact on your breathing and health wasn't so good.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: When you related that to your smoking, so you managed to reduce your smoking.
Client: Yeah, yeah. I sort of—
Therapist: So you've made our decision to do that?
Client: it-it-it's-- you know, she will, ""Why don't you give up? You've gone so far, why don't you just stop?"" But I don't want to.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: It's-it's-- I-I enjoy it, um—
Therapist: Yeah, and it's hard to get to stop something you enjoy, isn't it?
Client: Well, yeah. I mean, you know, the thing is that you get to, you know, you've got to-- when you get down to that, you, uh, you have to regulate sort of-
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You know, you have to be quite strong-willed about, I suppose, in a way.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: So you say, ""Okay, well, you don't have a cigarette unless you have a cup of coffee. [laughs]
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know.
Therapist: But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?
Client: Oh, yeah, yeah. I have two sugars. A couple of sugar in coffee. Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: So we cut that down as I say.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: But the problem goes that coffee, we're up to 8 or so, 10 cups of coffee a day now.
Therapist: You're drinking more coffee. So what I've heard you say so far is, if I can just start right back from the beginning and you used to come in and sais, ""I went to the doctor."" You went for-- it sounds like you went for just a checkup.
Client: No, you know, there's a friend of mine, one of the guys down the rugby club, he said- he said, ""I'm going for my annual, you know-
Therapist: MIT.
Client: -warranty of fitness, sort of thing, you know. And I thought, now that's an idea, not been to one of those.
Therapist: Got to check out, why not?
Client: So I'm 55, and you read in the papers, you know, it's that at 55 you will-- you know, heart disease is more prevalent
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: -and all these sorts of things that you get around this middle-age time. So I thought, ""Well, I'll go and have one."" And frankly, when I went along, I was very confident. I thought, you know, the doctor is going to saying, ""Hmm, I wish I was as healthy as you,"" sort of thing.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, but unfortunately, uh, he-he came up with this. And it's the only thing I think he really came up with. I think-
Therapist: So everything else looked pretty good?
Client: My cholesterol is quite good, not too bad.
Therapist: Cholesterol good, your weight is good.
Client: Yeah-yeah. Not too bad.
Therapist: Um, you are smoking, but you've managed to reduce that.
Client: Well, yeah, I've cut it down, yeah. I mean, that's been three years, mind.
Therapist: And anything else, you know, you go ticking down the list. The tire is good, oil good.
Client: Absolutely.
Therapist: So we're looking good.
Client: And then we come to this-
Therapist: And ah, hang on.
Client: -too much sugar in the tank, or something. I don't know.
Therapist: Yeah, there's something wrong with the, uh, with this bit.
Client: So, yeah.
Therapist: And it doesn't quite fit with how you see your own lifestyle.
Client: No.
Therapist: Because you've-- it sounds like what you've been doing, you've made some conscious effort to be aware of some of those things you might think are important.
Client: I mean, yeah. I mean, you know, the thing is, you see, the thing is, and I mean, and probably you've-- I think you've heard this before, but people, they turn around, oh, uh, you know, doom and gloom prophets, you shouldn't drink.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: You shouldn't smoke.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And then I think to myself, ""Well, maybe I shouldn't socialize."" And then after that, ""Well, maybe I shouldn't be alive.""
Therapist: So like a domino effect, and they'll all be just sitting-
Client: You know. I mean, what-what-what's going on here? This is- this is- this is so many people's lives.
Therapist: Mm-hm.
Client: And um, I suppose, you know, if it came down to it, then, and somebody said, ""Well, you can solve this problem by taking a pill once a day, um, you know, it will keep it down, and there will be no problems,"" Then I-I could go with that. But what I don't want to do, um, the doctor was saying, or insinuating, that I'd have to change my lifestyle.
Therapist: A bit broad kind of like you've gotta change everything.
Client: Yeah. It was um, and I-I said, well, no. I'm sorry. [coughs] I'm not going to change my lifestyle. I've got to where I am. I'm reasonably happy. Okay, I wish I wasn't separated. Okay, I wish my kids were-were still around, um, you know. One of them is off now in, um, in-- back in Europe playing rugby in France.
Therapist: Yeah. And your thought was, yeah, right, I hear that, but actually, I don't want to make all these big changes in my life.
Client: No, I don't want to, because I don't feel that I need to.
Therapist: Feel like you need to. Yeah.
Client: I mean, it's you know, why?
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Um, I can't argue with a medical professional, Mark, because I know nothing, you know.
Therapist: The test, is the test, and experience, yeah.
Client: So, I mean, what-what-what-what suggestions would you have? I mean, what-what sort of-
Therapist: I don't know. I think it's up to you where we start, and that's the question I've got in my mind. You've mentioned a couple of things that you've already made some effort, or been conscious of. You've mentioned the diet, you've mentioned your smoking, those are two quite important aspects that we often talk about here in how people work.
Client: Is smoking related to diabetes then?
Therapist: It can have an impact, yes. So smoking, um, affects your blood system, so it hardens the arteries, um, and over time, it can have a significant impact on the healing of wounds. So people with Type II diabetes, often, if they get a cut, or a bruise, or something, it takes a long time to heal. Smoking reduces the amount of oxygen in your system, so that can further, you know, limit the time it takes your body to heal.
Client: Oh.
Therapist: So we know that smoking and Type II diabetes together-
Client: Don't help.
Therapist: -isn't a good combination.
Client: Is it okay if you have one without the other? I'm sorry, it's a silly question. [laughs]
Therapist: Well, the question is, I suppose, that I have for you is, where would you think, for you, would be a good place to start? If you were gonna make any changes, even small changes at the beginning, rather than just thinking, oh, I got to change everything, which it sounds like you're not prepared to, you know, do a whole lifestyle change, and I don't think that's what we're talking about here. Where would you feel most comfortable to start if you were gonna make any changes at all?
Client: Where would I start? Well, I-- What if about if I cut down on sugar in the coffee? If we could have long blacks, no milk, and no sugar.
Therapist: Yeah. Hmm, that might be a start.
Client: I think I could- I think I could probably handle that.
Therapist: Hm. What we also find is that people make these little changes, small changes, and that starts to kind of well, it makes them-
Client: Something of a rollover effect.
Therapist: -rollover, the domino effect starts to happen, and they start looking at other aspects.
Client: Domino effect, yeah.
Therapist: So rather than thinking, ""oh, my God, I have to change all these things. I've gotta stop smoking, I've gotta exercise more, I've gotta, you know, start eating more fruit and vegetables,"" you might start with these small changes, and then-
Client: I mean, how much exercise should I do a week?
Therapist: Um, I-I'm reluctant to give a prescription for that because I think it's really up to you. And I think it depends on how things go, as to how much you need to do.
Client: Right.
Therapist: You mentioned earlier on, the doctors talking about you monitoring your blood sugar.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So on how-- It depends on how-how that goes. Let's say, if you started doing that and you do some more exercise, you start to have longer blacks, rather than short blacks with lots of sugar. And you get down the sugar and you find your blood sugar starts to come down, then we're heading in the right direction.
Client: Okay, so—
Therapist: So it's really, I suppose, up to how things go for you, and you get that feedback. And if that's going in the right direction, you carry on doing and do some more of that.
Client: So, a-are we saying then that-that, really all I need to do, for this moment, is I can forget about everything, but cut out the sugar, uh, in the coffee and the milk-- I don't know, but you might as well, you know, milk without sugar is silly. But, um, if we do that, is that where we start?
Therapist: I think where we start is where you feel comfortable starting.
Client: Well, I mean that's something that's not difficult to do.
Therapist: Apples for breakfast.
Client: You start off at breakfast and get yourself an apple, a bit-a bit of apple and-and so on. Um—
Therapist: So what I'm hearing you're kind of saying is, that there's-- You're now starting to think of some very useful little starting points.
Client: Maybe.
Therapist: Not huge changes, but some little things you could do.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And it's kind of dawning on you there may be some possibilities here for making some changes. Let me ask you this. Um, let's say you put some of these things in place and you start to make some of these small changes.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Um, where do you see that taking you in the next set of three, four, five years? You know, where do you want to be in three to four years' time? What would be your ideal picture?
Client: Well, you know, and this is difficult because I don't feel unhealthy now.
Therapist: No.
Client: So, I suppose it would be fun to-- Maybe I should join a club or two, that's what I'm thinking because I'll be with mates.
Therapist: Yeah? You like the social aspect?
Client: I love the social aspect of it, and, um, there's-there's-- I know there's a bar in this club as well. I-- Don't-don't misunderstand me, I don't drink-
Therapist: No, no, I get that. I get that.
Client: -till-- You know, I'm not an alcoholic or anything like that, I—
Therapist: So part of that whole keeping fit and exercise stuff is actually the social side of it, isn't it?
Client: So yeah, so to get that balance, and maybe that's what I'm actually missing in life, and maybe this is, um-- I mean yes I do get up in the morning sometimes, and I suppose I do feel a bit—
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: You know? Even after a decent night's sleep, you know?
Therapist: Haven't quite that-
Client: And you need-- I'm getting this cup of coffee and maybe I'm—
Therapist: And the coffee helps a little bit because it perks you up?
Client: And that gets me going. Yeah.
Therapist: And the sugar in it helps too.
Client: Yeah, the sugar gives me the boost, I suppose. I-it's fantastic.
Therapist: So what I'm hearing is that your life, your work, your routines are-- Sometimes you're driving or you've got to keep awake, get up in the morning sometimes and you haven't quite got that buzz or the energy. You need a shot, and then throughout the day you might need just more shots to keep that energy up.
Client: Hmm. If I give up sugar in my coffee, give up the milk, black coffees, right?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: if I find some social form of exercise, like squash.
Therapist: And an activity which has got a starting to finish and it's something you do for a slot.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And then there's maybe some social aspects to it as well.
Client: Yeah, and then—
Therapist: You can see some benefits and some enjoyment that.
Client: And then, you know, give this, say, six months, I don't know what period it would be, then go back to the GP and say, ""Test me again.""
Therapist: That sounds like a great plan.
Client: And so maybe that would, uh—
Therapist: Yeah, sounds like a good idea.
Client: Maybe it's an idea. I mean—
Therapist: I think anything you do, it has to be something you've decided. You know, just start where you want to start. You've mentioned some really good ideas about possibly getting a little bit more exercise into your life, doing something like squash or something of that nature. You've mentioned some really good ideas about reducing the amount of sugar you-you-you're-you're intaking during the day, and coffee is a good place to start. Having an apple for breakfast, I think you mentioned that, a bit of fruit.
Client: Yeah, like my wife used to. Yeah.
Therapist: Those are some really good ideas and good starting points. So thinking about it like that, what-- Where are you now? What's your-- What-what-- Where-where is your thinking now?
Client: Well, you see, I mean, I'm thinking, ""Actually it might not be a bad idea this,"" because [chuckles] it would mean I could socialize harder, couldn't I? No, no I'm just joking. Uh, but, um, yeah, I mean, why not? Why not? Why not? It might be fun, it's a new path.
Therapist: What's to lose? What's to gain?
Client: Well, it would appear that there is something to gain, and-- I mean, I-- What do I lose? I don't know until I do it. But I'm thinking that if I do it and I do what I'm enjoying doing, I won't miss what I'm not doing. Does that make sense?
Therapist: It does make sense, yeah.
Client: Um, yeah I don't mind. I-- It's not a—
Therapist: So when you look at it, there's probably more to gain from making these changes than there is to lose.
Client: I'll talk to Billy about, um-- Billy is, um, he's the gym bloke.
Therapist: Right.
Client: I'll have a word with him because I'm due down the club tonight.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Really.
Therapist: So you've got to work these things on your mind. You know, the-- And workout where's the place to start.
Client: Yeah, I think that you say where-where you're at now, where you're going, where—
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -and-and-and this is what I've got to do. I think I'm in a rut. I think that's where I've—
Therapist: You've been stuck?
Client: I'm-I'm just-- I'm-I'm satisfiedly sort of contented, uh, sitting in this- in this rut and, um, that my doctor has actually di-diagnosed me with diabetes 2-
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: -which he says can be managed, and you seem to be insinuating that it can be managed.
Therapist: Indeed, yeah.
Client: Uh, maybe this is a blessing, actually-
Therapist: So rather than--
Client: -because I think to myself, ""Well, if someday, I am diagnosed with diabetes, I'd just carry on and-""
Therapist: Carrying on.
Client: ""-sitting in the corner of the bar, and chat, and talk and probably get fat."" I don't know, and make it worse. And, yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.
Therapist: So it's been a bit of a-a bit of a shock, but now you kinda reflect on it.
Client: Yeah, that's cool.
Therapist: Maybe this is the-
Client: That's really cool.
Therapist: -bit of a shake that I needed, you know, just sort of remind me. I might feel okay. I might-- From my perspective, your perspective, you're thinking, ""Well, what's the problem? Everything's fine.""
Client: Mm.
Therapist: But now you seem to be thinking looking and thinking, ""Maybe things weren't, or aren't, as good as I thought they were.""
Client: Yeah, I mean, I think you're quite right. I think you just—
Therapist: Things could be better?
Client: I don't know, you become sedentary, don't you? No, it seems that-- No, actually, this is quite exciting. It quite [unintelligible 00:31:28]
Therapist: Yeah, I sense that. I sense that in you that you're--
Client: I think to myself, I think, ""Oh,"" I think go—
Therapist: Quite invigorated with the idea of--
Client: Yeah. I mean, this is- this is- this is cool, it's like an old challenge again.
Therapist: Making some of these changes. Yeah.
Client: This is good. And, um—
Therapist: You're up for the challenge?
Client: I think I am. I mean, I never thought about it, but when I think about it now it's, ""What am I doing here?"" Why am I like this? Why am I just happy contented to drift?
Therapist: So think about when you were-- This-this is an interesting question to see what you think. You were- you were a coach. You-- Maybe you'll be a coach again.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: What would you say if you were talking to yourself, if you like, you know, if you were the coach saying, ""Right--""
Client: Oh, so if I was obs- if I was sort of-
Therapist: Yeah, what-what would you be saying?
Client: -observing as it were?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Watching myself, what would I say? I-I-- Well, I would say, you know, are you happy?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: That-- Are you contented with that performance of you and your team?
Therapist: And, I suppose, our own personalized a little bit like that, there's lots of different aspects that need to be tweaked.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Modified and looked at, to get the best out of ourselves, to get the best out of the opportunities we have.
Client: I think you're- I think you're right. I think, um-- And again, you put them together and it's-it's-it's becoming-- It's-it's a sort of a-an individual team job, isn't it really?
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: That, okay, do a bit of this and do a bit of that.
Therapist: Some good things I'm- some things I'm good at and there are some other aspects we think, ""Well--""
Client: Yeah, but I don't have to give up anything really, do I?
Therapist: It's not about giving up your personality or-
Client: No.
Therapist: -changing who you are fundamentally.
Client: No it's not. It's not.
Therapist: It's just tweaking things. Just fine-tuning a few areas and being a bit more aw-aware of one aspect of your life a bit more, like the food choices or whatever. Well, Mike, I-I've really enjoyed listening to your perspective, and your story a little bit, and it's helped me a lot to get an idea about where you're coming from, and a little bit about who you are, and what's happened in your past. And-and we've also talked a bit about what's going to happen next. And you've come up with some great ideas. What I hear you saying is that, you know, before all this, before you met the GP, things are going fine.Well, as you would of-- As, you know, as you'd seen it, you were just doing your thing, and getting on working, and being busy, and being successful, and then suddenly this diagnosis, this doctor tells you that you've got a problem.
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: It comes along to me and talk today a bit about how you felt about that. Initially, it can be quite a bit of a-bit of a shock. It didn't quite fit with how you saw things.
Client: True, true.
Therapist: And as we've been talking, I'm hearing you're saying that maybe if you look back to where you were before you went to the doctor, things weren't quite that right, maybe. Things weren't as good as you thought they were.
Client: Now that I think about it- now that I think about it, maybe.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Maybe they were.
Therapist: And what I also hear you saying, it's possibly the-- It's now possibly more possible, in your mind, that you could make some of these changes, rather than bring broad-brush, you know, huge changes to your lifestyles. It's not about changing who you are, it's not changing huge facets of your life, but maybe small steps that need to be taken.
Client: Yeah, you see—
Therapist: What you're kind of thinking about what those might.
Client: Mm. When your life comes to a halt-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -your family splits up, or whatever, and you don't have anymore, I-I think you stop caring really. Uh, y-you know, you stop caring about yourself
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Because everything is just f-
Therapist: Nobody there too.
Client: Nobody there, [crosstalk] it's true and so,-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -you know,-
Therapist: Mhm.
Client: -you don't care.
Therapist: So now it's time-
Client: So that's maybe [crosstalk]
Therapist: -to think about looking after yourself a bit more.
Client: Maybe, a bit selfish but maybe why not?
Therapist: Why not?
Client: Why not? Yeah, that's a good idea.
Therapist: Yeah. So, we've run out of time but I also want to ask you a final question, where to from here, what's next?
Client: Oh right, well, wha-what we talked about. Now, you know, uh, okay, uh, coffee. Right? No sugar.
Therapist: You'll start with that?
Client: I'll start with that.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, I'm gonna, um, I'll be talking to Bill, uh-
Therapist: The gym.
Client: -about the gym but-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -I like the idea of, actually again doing squash-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -or something else-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -and I'm gonna go down to the rugby club and I'll- I know that will be accepted. I'll offer my services again because-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -it was reasonably successful.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And, uh—
Therapist: And you also mentioned you'll perhaps go and- back and see the doctor and just give him a bit of an update as to-
Client: No, [crosstalk] oh, well, okay, yeah I didn't- yeah, I'll go back and say-- Well, look, I'd-I'd rather not go back to the doctor and say, ""I'm gonna do this, this, this-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -this and this.
Therapist: Mhm.
Client: This is between you and me.
Therapist: Yep.
Client: All right?
Therapist: It's fine.
Client: But this is what I'm gonna do. All right? And like I said, I'm gonna make the inquiries, I will start there-
Therapist: Sure.
Client: -I will give up, uh, I'll give up the V drinks,-
Therapist: Mhm.
Client: -I think, um, look for some better wine. [laughter] Um, and-and I-I'd take an interest really.
Therapist: You are gonna make a start?
Client: I'll take an interest really and-and, uh, but it is quite exciting, Mark.
Therapist: It is. Well, just to help you, because there's probably a lot of other questions you might have, other questions that might come up after this session.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -before we go, I'd like to just-just give you a lot of- some information that might help-help you.
Client: Not too much.
Therapist: Not too much, just some stuff that might just give you a little bit of background information on-
Client: Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: -some of the things that have-
Client: Just give me a bit of background, really.
Therapist: -around type- around Type II diabetes and some,-
Client: Oh, yeah, and what it is-
Therapist: [unintelligible 00:36:53] some of that.
Client: -because I don't really know. Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: Um, and I'd like to us- for us to meet again, so to catch up with you and make an appointment before you leave. Just to see how things are going and-
Client: Okay.
Therapist: -see what sort of little changes you've managed to make. I'd be really [unintelligible 00:37:07]-
Client: Wha-what are we talking about, sort of few months down the line?
Therapist: It's really up to you. Probably a little bit sooner would be good.
Client: What, in about a month's time?

Example 1
Client: But-but the wheezing is something that I've definitely noticed a little bit.
Therapist: I guess I also wonder whether, regardless of-of if your asthma symptoms are connected to Oscar, that may be part of you feels like it's worth it because he's been-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: -such a big part of your life for so long.
Answer: complex

Example 2
Client: Um, I'm just- yeah I just like to have a few drinks. I mean, you know, obviously, I-I have, uh, this diagnosed condition, and-and I think, you know, if I were able to, you know, maybe take a few hits off of the joint and have a couple of beers, I think that's about the same as taking the medicine.
Therapist: Well, you know, what, I-- There are a lot of people that wouldn't disagree with you on that exactly. You know, so, um, uh, but I know that they-they were never quite sure how they were all interacting all together. Like the, um- the weed kind of tends to make people a little paranoid anyway.
Client: Yeah, I-I-I got to be careful with it. If I take more than a hit or two of it, it-it-it can be a bit of a problem.
Therapist: Yeah. Why, what happens if you take a little too much of it?
Answer: none

Example 3
Client: That's a good way to sum it up. And it's-- Well, you understand it, uh, it's just- it's not good.
Therapist: Mm. So, and then you said, you don't like how it makes you act, um, if you can tell me a little bit about that.
Answer: simple

Example 4
Client: Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know.
Therapist: But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?
Answer: complex

Example 5
Client: I wanna stay friends with them. I don't want- I don't want them to just-
Therapist: You don't wanna lose your support group, yeah. You just wanna them to support you in being healthy, while helping them, raising the babe, and so we're just taking path B. You don't wanna lose them, just maybe the lifestyle it sounds like.
Answer: none

Example 6
Client: Um, I mean, I guess- I guess I need some strategies for figuring out how to ease stress without, I guess, getting high.
Therapist: Okay. And that's a very good reason for being here. Um, can you talk to me about maybe some of your-- the goals that you have?

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: Hi, Sandra.
Client: Hi.
Therapist: Thanks for coming in and talking with me for a couple of minutes. I understand you don't have very much time, but I really appreciate you stopping by.
Client: Well, I came today because my daughter's in the hospital as well. I think it's important to quit, but I enjoy smoking. I'm not ready to give it up right now. My life is too much in turmoil.
Therapist: So I get the impression that there are some things that you're concerned about, but that overall, coming in here wasn't necessarily the first thing that was on your mind when you came to the hospital with your daughter. Um, so can you tell me, what was it that made it possible for you to even come in? What-what were some of the things you were thinking about?
Client: I think it's important because I've-- I feel I'm a bad role model for my children, and my daughter's turning 12, and already, some of her friends have tried smoking, so I don't want her to think it's a good thing.
Therapist: So the last thing you'd want is for your daughter to start smoking.
Client: I smoked when I was young, and I certainly don't want it for her.
Therapist: Hmm. And it sounds like your smoking, setting an example, those are some things that-that you're also, uh, a bit concerned about, um, but as you said earlier, not-not really ready to put down your cigarettes immediately.
Client: Well, that's true. It seems so hard. I'm just not ready for this right now.
Therapist: So Sandra, what's good about smoking? What do you like about it?
Client: It's very enjoyable, relaxing, you know, a stress reliever. When I'm at work, we all go out and smoke and chit chat and, you know, talk about things. I would hate to not smoke, really. I'd be left out.
Therapist: What else? Tell me what else is good about it.
Client: Hmm, I like to have a cigarette after I eat. It sort of tells my brain I'm finished, stop eating, I'm full. So it's a- it's a way to-- you know, sometimes I'll have a cigarette instead of a snack, so it's a way to control my weight.
Therapist: Okay. So is there anything else that you like about it?
Client: Let me think. Well, I just enjoy it. I think it's, uh-- it's not good for me, I know, but I'm so used to smoking. I don't really think about quitting too much.
Therapist: So let me make sure that I understand all of the good things about smoking, the things that you like about it, and let me know if I've missed anything or left anything out.
Client: Okay.
Therapist: So it sounds like it's a way to relax. It's a way to socialize with your friends from work, and it's hard to imagine what it would be like for you at work if you couldn't go outside and smoke.
Client: That's true. Yeah.
Therapist: You also mentioned that smoking is a way to manage your weight, and concern that if you were-were going to quit smoking, what that would do in terms of, um, gaining weight, and that smoking after meals is pleasurable, that it's something that would be really hard to give up.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: I also heard that it's very much a part of your life. It's something that you've done for a really long time and almost impossible to think about yourself as a non-smoker. Does that capture, for you, some of the good things or things that are keeping you smoking?
Client: Exactly.
Therapist: So I'm hearing there are some things you really like about smoking. What about the other side? Can you tell me about some of the not-so-good things?

Client: Yeah, I'm all right.
Therapist: Yeah. Hey, it's good to see you here and good to see you here on time. Yeah, it's really good to see a good start to the-- to your probation time with us here is to see you being here on time. So how did you get here today?
Client: Just caught the bus.
Therapist: Yeah, caught the bus to-to that-- to the stop outside the office?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah, okay. So I'm noticing that this isn't the first time that you've been to see someone at probation and it's not your first, um, community sentence. So I was wondering when you're sitting on the bus thinking about coming here, what was- what was going through your head about being here?
Client: Just a waste of my time.
Therapist: Just was feeling like, ""Ugh, it's gonna be a waste of my time coming here.""
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: Mmh. So how come you thought it was going to be a waste of your time? What was it based on?
Client: Last time didn't really work out that well.
Therapist: Yeah, didn't- didn't work out very well.
Client: Nothing really helped me.
Therapist: Okay. So you're hoping that it was gonna help you and it didn't. That was-- ended up feeling like a waste of your time.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Mm. So it sounds you're worried that it's gonna be a waste of your time this time too.
Client: Yeah, I'd say so.
Therapist: Mm, okay. So what sort of things do you think made it a waste of time last time?
Client: She didn't really listen to me, just told me what to do. She just bossed me around.
Therapist: Okay, the probation officer we're talking about here?
Client: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Therapist: Mm. So it felt like she bossed you around, didn't really listen to you.
Client: Yeah, she didn't really care.
Therapist: Okay, so actually having someone listen to you and hear about what you're saying is important to you?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Mm. So what's it gonna be like do you think working with me 'cause I'm also a female probation officer? Um, I'm wondering what-what's it gonna be like do you think?
Client: I-I don't care that you're a woman. It's just- it's that you don't know what it's like to be me.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: You have a different upbringing and live in a different place of town. Just-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -you wouldn't understand.
Therapist: Okay, and all of those things are true.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: You're right. I don't know what it's like to be you and what I'm getting a sense of is that it's actually important that the person sitting opposite you in this role needs to understand what it's like to be you. Is that right?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah, okay. So I guess the invitation for both of us really over the next few months of, um, on the sentence is for us to get an understanding about what it's like to be you.
Client: Yeah, so it is.
Therapist: Yeah, okay. So in terms of the things that have brought you here, in terms of the things that have got you into trouble and got you into offending, I'm wondering how interested you are in, um, really getting an understanding of it. So one or zero is like, ""Ugh, not interested at all.""
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: 100 is like, ""I'm totally interested and-and getting it nailed and sorted and, you know, getting on the straight and narrow."" Where would you be on that scale?
Client: Well, not too high. It's not like I'm out killing people or anything. It's just-

Client: Well, yeah. I mean, as far as I know, I hadn't seen him for-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -I don't know how many years.
Therapist: Mm. So you got this knowledge as a witness there's some family history of diabetes in the past?
Client: Apparently so. Yes, apparently so.
Therapist: Doctor mentioned that as being a factor.
Client: Mm, I mean, it is hereditary, is it?
Therapist: That's certainly true. Yes. We know that people who've had parents or have been in the past, there is a hereditary factor or genetic factor in-involved.
Client: A genetic factor. And so, does that mean that if you've got, um, if you've got a history of this within your family-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -if it's a gene-- you are more likely than not to get it?
Therapist: Correct. Yeah.
Client: Also, it's—
Therapist: But it's not inevitable.
Client: Right. Okay.
Therapist: Because its genes or the-the-the-the hereditary factor is not the only factor that causes it or is involved in it happening to you. So there's other factors that come into play.
Client: I'm sure you're going to tell me what they are.
Therapist: Well, you've-you've mentioned some of the things you know, and one of those is hereditary factors. You mentioned that the doctor mentioned that. And what else do you know or have you heard? You say you haven't had a lot of time to do the research. What else? Other things you've.
Client: To be frank, Mark, I honestly don't know. I mean, I honestly don't know what causes it because I've never had any reason. It came upon me from the GP and it took me back.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, the hereditary thing I thought, well, maybe that's the explanation.
Therapist: That makes a bit of sense.
Client: And why go any further, it's there?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Can't help it.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: They live pretty long lives, they did, all right.
Therapist: They managed with it.
Client: Relatives relatively went into their 70s.
Therapist: Okay. I don't know if it'd be helpful for you if you'd like to know a little bit more about some of the factors involved in time Type II diabetes.
Client: Well.
Therapist: If that would help.
Client: If there's something that you think that-- Yes. Yes, of course.
Therapist: Well, I'll perhaps share with you what I know from working with other people and some of the things I've experienced in working with people.
Client: Okay.
Therapist: And see what you make of it. See if it fits a little bit more with where you're at. We know that there is a strong family factor or hereditary factor, so that's one aspect. So also it tends to happen a little bit later in life, rather than something you might get when you're a teenager, this type of diabetes. So-so it's a later onset. It takes a bit of time for it to develop maybe. And the main reason I think, um, the main aspect of it is that it, have you heard about insulin.
Client: I've heard of it yeah.
Therapist: So that's a hormone or a chemical, it allows you to utilize sugar in your body.
Client: Right.
Therapist: All right. And Type II diabetes typically people have a resistance or a resistance to insulin in their cells, in their fat cells or their muscle cells or liver cells. They can't use insulin. And so sugar builds up in your system.
Client: Are you saying that they-they like they can't digest insulin or is that?
Therapist: You need insulin in your cells, individual cells in muscle or in fat or wherever to, um, use up excess sugar or to utilize sugar.
Client: Oh, I see. So-so it's like a-it's like a balance.
Therapist: That's right.
Client: So insulin you-you.
Therapist: Kind of, as your.
Client: You have yourself draws bar.
Therapist: Yap.
Client: Or something, and then what balances that out in the body is the insulin taking off the excess.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Or-or digesting? Should I say the excessive sugars?
Therapist: That's a good way to think.
Client: Is that what happened?
Therapist: Exactly. And what's happening in Type II diabetes is your-your fat cells and liver cells and muscle cells are resistant to insulin. It's almost like they're saying we can't use that.
Client: Why?
Therapist: And if-- Well, there's a number of-- We're not entirely sure, there's a lot of research still going on as to how this happens and how that could be modified. But what we do know is that, um, one of the key things in managing it is to try and modify or modulate, control the amount of sugar that are in your system.
Client: Right. Okay.
Therapist: Yeah. So there's a couple of things that we know that people with Type II diabetes have to look after and have to think about if they want to control the amount of sugar that's in their system, which is the main issue that's causing some of the health problems that people have with Type II diabetes. Too much sugar, and if it's not able to be utilized in the blood cell, in the fat cells, or liver cells, and the muscle cells stays in your bloodstream. And that can cause problems with your circulation. So too high blood sugar and too low a blood sugar can be a problem. So sugar is the main concern in Type II- Type II diabetes.And you mentioned earlier on, a couple of things that the doctor-- You've mentioned some signs that he was kind of a little bit concerned about. Well, what things did you notice over the-over the last month or so?
Client: You mean, personally?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Well, I didn't know. I mean, the thing is you see that-- I mean, I did think about this a little bit and I thought, well, over time, if things happen slowly, you don't really notice.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: As you get older.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I don't-I don't leap over five bar gates like I used to, you know, um, as opposed to, uh, running with the backs now, I tend to spend more time, you know, with my old mates in the bar.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: At the rugby club and-and-and the such like, yeah. And, um, the fish I'm hooking, I'm not after the kings anymore, I go for the snapper now, it's a bit easier, you know.
Therapist: A slightly more sedate lifestyle.
Client: Yeah, absolutely. You just do.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: You just do. Um, so you're less demanding, I guess, on your-on your body, you realize, and you don't really want to do these things anyway. You know, you let the youngsters get home.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Been there, done that. So you don't really notice. So I'm coming back to this diagnosis I had from my GP and him saying, ""You've got diabetes 2,"" well, I should feel like that, shouldn't I?
Therapist: Yeah. It should feel like there's something really wrong with you.
Client: Yeah, I mean.
Therapist: What's-how have you been feeling over the last month? So, you say you're very busy you're doing a lot of work.
Client: Yeah, I mean I'm a busy person. All right? I uh, my work uh, I work in insurance, so I'm always hopping from one place to another place.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, I haven't noticed.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: I really haven't noticed how, um, okay I get a bit--I suppose I get a bit out of breath sometimes.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: If I rush too much that-that's true. Um, I suppose, um, I don't go upstairs two at a time anymore, I use one at a time.
Therapist: So a little bit sort of energy is not quite there sometimes? The vitality.
Client: Oh, certainly the energy I have is-is not what I-what I had. I mean I do need to, you know, I'm busy but I do need to sit down, um, uh, I do need to sit down and relax with a cup of coffee, you know, and, uh, things.
Therapist: Yeah, Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, more than I would normally.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But that would be, that would be about it.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, is it getting worse? I don't know. I-I-I suppose. What worse? Is it-is it increasing? Well, to say, I don't really notice it.
Therapist: You haven't noticed it. So it's a progressive, you know, you've just seen this, as-as you got older, things have slowed down. You know those activities you used to do, but that's kind of like what happens.
Client: Yeah, yeah. Um, at least, that's what I think. I mean I don't know if you're telling me that I should be more active or my GP is saying I should be more active.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, as I say, uh, you know I-I don't do any regular form of exercise, I have to say, not anymore.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: But maybe I-maybe I don't know.
Therapist: Hmm, a bit of a mystery there.
Client: I mean I've got uh, well I-I mean I've got a great lifestyle. I mean if it's very-it-it's very good. I mean I've got all my mates in down at the rugby club. And I've got uh, you know even in the summer when that's a bit damn. I used to coach rugby and I coached cricket when I finished playing. So-so I've got the-the guys in the cricket club, um, you know, for the-for the, uh, for the summer evenings. And, uh, and then, uh, the-then, of course, we've got the fishing, and that's all of us combined. We're a big gang, really.
Therapist: Really? So what I'm hearing is there's actually a lot of aspects in your life which are really good.
Client: Oh, I think my life yeah. My life is great.
Therapist: From your perspective, things are going well?
Client: My life is great, and then you turn around and say, ""Hey you've got-- you-you're ill, you're sick.
Therapist: Yeah. It doesn't fit.
Client: And um, no I'm not. But you see, he said to me that he's gonna put me on some sort of, uh, a daily monitoring of, is it sugar levels?
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: And I'm gonna have to take regular pills.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Well frankly, the only pills I take are sort of paracetamols.
Therapist: Yeah. When you get uh, a headache.
Client: For a bit of the head in the morning, you know.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um.
Therapist: So the idea of having to test-test your blood sugar and take medications is kinda like off--
Client: Come on, you know.
Therapist: And you know that's a bit too-
Client: Well, life is too short.
Therapist: Too much.
Client: You know it's the truth.
Therapist: Yeah. Okay.
Client: I mean you know—
Therapist: And you're here today and that's probably something in you you've thought well I'll follow this through, you know I'll-I'll come along and see what-see what they've got to say. And I'm just wondering for this session, for the time we have today, there's a number of things we could talk about. You mentioned a couple of things about your lifestyle and, um, medication is one thing you've been told by the doctor you might need to do that. And a number of things that we could talk about today. Which-which area would you think would be useful for you to focus on?
Client: Well there is-there is something that you sort of prompted me to think about, and, um, I split up-- My wife and I, we split up several years ago now. And, um, you know we've been married for many many years.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: And um, I think she used to look after me because she used to do the cooking and-and-and stuff like that.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And I have to say that I'm not the best cook in the world.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, and-and being on the run all the time and you know once I get back home, it's, you know, it's time to go down to the rugby club or whatever it might be, uh, we're out with the mates. And, uh, I-I do I suppose my food is not as healthy perhaps as it used to be when she was around. She's moved down to Hamilton to live with her mother, if you've met her mother. Anyway, but, um.
Therapist: So then, since you've been on your own since you've separated, divorced and you've noticed that the things you eat and how you eat has changed.
Client: Yeah, I mean mates and their wives are pretty cool about it sometimes.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Because, you know, they'll invite me for dinner and so on.
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: And, yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess, you know, that's when you, well, or whatever reason, you split up in life.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You start looking at the home life of somebody else, you're thinking, ""Hmm, I use d to have this.""
Therapist: Hmm. Yeah, yeah.
Client: And you think, "" This is nice food, "" isn't it? and you know.
Therapist: Yeah. And your-- part of your wife used to do a lot of that for you?
Client: Oh, she would do all the cooking. Yeah, yeah,
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I never bothered to boil an egg in the water, you know.
Therapist: And so she would kinda look after what you ate and healthy things that you had, spread in front of you and off you go.
Client: Totally. I mean, I was just in charge of the wine, you know.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. And now you have to think about what you might eat and sometimes you don't eat the best.
Client: Well I-- This is what I'm saying. Maybe I'm not thinking about it. Maybe that's the thing.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Maybe I'm just—
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You know, because it-- you know this-- the pizza shop's just on the road.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And then there's-- I mean, okay, I confess that lunchtime, occasionally, it's uh, I'm hungry and McDonald's is very convenient
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -or Kentucky Fried or whatever.
Therapist: Very appealing, isn't it?
Client: You know, it's very easy. and then, um, then you think to yourself, well-- I mean, I do think of myself that maybe I should have a few vegetables around here or whatever. But then you go out into the supermarkets, you know, and you can pick up, uh, your- one of your TV dinners.
Therapist: Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm.
Client: So you bring those in and you open them up and put them in the microwave and there's vegetables there.
Therapist: Yeah they look pretty good on the plate, don't they?
Client: Yeah, it looks- it looks fine, you know, et cetera. I mean, so that will happen occasionally if I've got a night in. But cooking-wise, no, I haven't cooked anything, um, other than boil the water for the kettle for a cup o coffee.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -for ages.
Therapist: They're food choices in what you eat and what's in your diet it's not what-something you actually you've actually been aware of or had to think about in the past.
Client: Yeah. I do miss her breakfast. I have to say, we used to have get a nice breakfast.
Therapist: So one thing that you noticed is diet and the eating patterns and-
Client: Well—
Therapist: -when you eat. That's one aspect. What other aspects do you think you've-- you would be--?
Client: Well, I used to be quite a heavy smoker, right? I mean, I'd smoke a pack in a half a day. And I knew that wasn't doing me any good.
Therapist: Right.
Client: I mean the thing is when you're a-- I mean, I've always smoked. So, but when you're young and you're a sportsman, you know—
Therapist: You kinda juggle those two things and kinda--
Client: Well, the two things they balance out, you know and everybody else is
Therapist: You still run and have a cigarette?
Client: You know, you pass a cigarette down the backline almost, don't you? You know, just before the game gets—
Therapist: Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, part of the culture.
Client: Yeah, part of the of the whole thing. And it's changed a bit now, because in my day when we were playing, of course, it was a very much more of a social game, which was spent-spent in the rugby club.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: That's why you played and it was a big buddy-buddy thing.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: That was rugby and cricket was the same really.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Um, but now—
Therapist: But over the years, you've actually reduced your smoking or you've stopped altogether or at times?
Client: Well I-I, yeah. I was getting a bit sort of-- I was getting a bit, you know, a bit wheezy and I thought, ""I'll cut this out.""
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: But I enjoy smoking. I really do enjoy it. So I cut it down to I suppose it's about 10 a day now.
Therapist: Okay, so you meant to reduce.
Client: Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: You were noticing that it's having an impact on your breathing and health wasn't so good.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: When you related that to your smoking, so you managed to reduce your smoking.
Client: Yeah, yeah. I sort of—
Therapist: So you've made our decision to do that?
Client: it-it-it's-- you know, she will, ""Why don't you give up? You've gone so far, why don't you just stop?"" But I don't want to.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: It's-it's-- I-I enjoy it, um—
Therapist: Yeah, and it's hard to get to stop something you enjoy, isn't it?
Client: Well, yeah. I mean, you know, the thing is that you get to, you know, you've got to-- when you get down to that, you, uh, you have to regulate sort of-
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You know, you have to be quite strong-willed about, I suppose, in a way.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: So you say, ""Okay, well, you don't have a cigarette unless you have a cup of coffee. [laughs]
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know.
Therapist: But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?

Therapist: Okay. So, you're concerned about the consequences, and you really care about your baby, and you want to give your baby the best start you can.
Client: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Therapist: And you're wondering a little bit about this time that we're going to spend together.
Client: Yeah. He didn't really tell me what to expect. He just said, ""Go- go see her as well.""
Therapist: So here you are today and, um, you're sharing that you have been drinking alcohol throughout your pregnancy.
Client: Yeah. Um, I didn't find out I was pregnant until probably two-ish months in-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -and I had already been drinking then. Um, I've been really trying not to, but, you know, weekends come around, and, um, all my friends are kind of partying and stuff, and it's been hard to, like, break that habit.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. So, there's this external pressure coming from the people you care about to sort of stay in the scene.
Client: A little bit. I think if I- if I talk to them, it would be fine, but it's-it's weird, right? Like I'm the only one of my friends that's, like, taking this step and having a kid, and they don't really know how to handle that.
Therapist: Kind of feels like You're between two worlds. In one world, you're preparing to be a mother and bring a baby into this world, and this other world is the world that you've been in for a while where you're kind of having a good time and-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -drinking and your friends are-
Client: Yeah, like, I'm- I'm still, like, I'm only in my 20s, and-and for everyone else, it's like, ""Okay, it's party time,"" and now I kind of have to, like, break out of that.
Therapist: Okay. So, this party-time world's- are you feeling like this is something you want to move out of and move into that mom world? Or does it feel like I want to hang out there still too?
Client: There's, yeah, there's part of me that still wants to live that out because I'm not going to have another chance, like once this kid comes, it's-it's going to be over. I know I'm gonna- I know I'm going to have to change.
Therapist: So, for you, you're feeling like once the baby comes and actually in your arms, then things are going to change, but right now, while you're pregnant, you're thinking, ""I can kind of hang out in both worlds a little bit,"" but part of you may be thinking maybe that's not the case. It's time to go to the mom world maybe.
Client: Yeah. Probably. And I'm also feeling like it's too late. I already screwed it up.
Therapist: Okay. So, you've got a lot of concerns about what's happened to- up until this point, as far as your drinking. What do you know about, um, drinking alcohol throughout pregnancy?
Client: Well, I know, like, they say not to, but I thought because my friends didn't really care, I thought, ""Okay. Like maybe-maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe it's just what they tell you."" Just like drinking, in general, is bad.
Therapist: So, you were thinking because your-your friends weren't pressuring you to stop drinking, that-that it must be okay.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And then there's this other part of you that's- was thinking maybe it's not okay.
Client: Yeah, like, I should probably have trusted my gut.
Therapist: So, your gut is telling you what? Tell me about that.
Client: It's telling me that what I'm doing is wrong and it's probably hurting my kid and that- that I'm gonna really regret that once I actually get my kid.
Therapist: And you really wanna do what's best for your babe. And kind of wondering, um, how to move forward from here, is that where you wanna, you know, kind of focus in on, or what are your thoughts about giving up drinking altogether?
Client: Um, I'm definitely it's not-- I think I could probably do it. It's just- it-it comes hard when you're, like, in that moment. You're around your friends and they're drinking and you don't wanna be- you don't wanna be the mom at that moment. You wanna be yourself. You wanna be who you were before.
Therapist: So, you kind of have this identity, dual identity going on. I wanna be that person, yet, that person-
Client: And so many people, when they have kids, they just vanish from their friends. And I don't wanna be that person. I don't wanna be that person that just has a kid and they're completely-completely different.
Therapist: Mm. So, embraces this life of the picket fence and the, you know, the little house and having the baby in this-
Client: Yeah, suburbs. Yeah.
Therapist: So, you don't wanna be that- that- that woman that's just sort of living in this house with the baby carriage, and at the same time, that world's kind of saying it's behind you.
Client: Yeah, I-I guess. Like, I don't wanna- I don't wanna lose my friends because of this. And I don't wanna put pressure on them to change because they're, I mean, they're good people. They're just—
Therapist: You care about them.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: It's just the scene that they're-they're still in because their life maybe hasn't taken that change that your life has made. And so now, you're here and you're not sure. You want the baby, but you're not sure about the suburbs and the picket fence thing. You're not sure—
Client: I don’t want that.
Therapist: You don't want that.
Client: No.
Therapist: You want this baby.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And you wanna be, um, take care of your baby as the baby's growing.
Client: Like, I wanna- I wanna be responsible for this thing.
Therapist: You don't wanna let your baby down.
Client: No.
Therapist: And at the same time, it's hard to let go of the past, but on the other hand, you're thinking, ""I don't have a choice. I've got to look this way."" Is that kind of what it feels like?
Client: I guess so. I feel like I've already made a choice and already made some bad choices with this.
Therapist: Nina, I'm wondering, what's your hope for the future? When you think about where you are today, um, what do you hope for when you look ahead?
Client: Well, I-I kept the kid because I wanted-- It was almost like that push, that sign for me to, like, move forward and become like an adult because it's scary, right? Like I-I still feel like a teenager sometimes. And having that push to be a real person is really-- It's a lot of pressure and I-I want to raise this kid well. I don't wanna- I don't wanna let my kid down. I don't wanna, you know, I don't wanna regret choosing to have this kid because I think it's the right time, but I don't wanna- I don't wanna make mistakes that make me realize maybe I'm not ready for this 'cause sometimes it feels like I'm not ready for this.
Therapist: You put your heart there that the baby is really- it was almost kind of like a sign for you that was saying, ""This baby is giving you a kind of a new chance at life, or giving you a plan B,"" and you guys both get to decide what plan B is gonna look like.
Client: Yeah, I just guess it's easier said than done though. Like, it's, like, great, I can make all these changes and I can be a completely new person, but it's, like, at the end of the day, I'm still just who I am.
Therapist: While this baby's growing in you and you think of all the opportunities that could come out of this, there's a part of you that says, ""I'm still that same girl that was drinking and partying,"" and-and maybe not living the life you wanted to live.
Client: Yeah. And I'm just- you know, you can't just one day flick a switch and become a new person.
Therapist: While this baby feels like this is your second chance, you're wondering, ""Do I deserve that second chance?"" And then this other part of you that says, ""Why not? It's here and I wanna go for it.""
Client: Yeah, I guess that voice is just a little more stifled by the other one.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. You got a lot of people around you that are kind of pulling it down, and it's kind of taking you back to the old life. And the baby is a constant reminder that there’s this new life ahead.
Client: Yeah, it's gonna be very different when it actually comes.
Therapist: When you think about, you know, embracing this new life, and taking that different path, turning away from path A and moving into path B, how confident are you that you can take path B and be successful in raising this baby, and letting go with the drinking and the life that you were in-in path A?
Client: I think I'm gonna have to be successful. I don't really- I don't have any other choice. Like I have to- I have to take that path.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. Tell me more about that, what makes you say, ""I have to take that path""? What makes you feel like you need that?
Client: Because I need to for my kid. It's- it's gonna be all screwed up if I don't.
Therapist: This part of you that says, ""I don't have an option to-to-to make this life better,"" it's wondering, ""Do I have the confidence to be able to make that life a reality?"" What do you think you need to increase your confidence that you can do this?
Client: I don't know, like, maybe- maybe actually talking to my friends and saying like- or maybe them actually being able to see this kid and go, ""Of course, of course, your- your choice makes sense. You--"" Maybe it would, you know, give them a wake-up call too if They actually, like, see it.
Therapist: So you're thinking that, um, once your friends see you with the baby in your arms that they too will see that there's a different path for them too?
Client: Or at least they'll feel less pressure to be who they want me to be.
Therapist: Mm, kind of feel like you're pulled between two worlds there.
Client: A little bit.
Therapist: It's not easy to be in that world and also having that constant reminder that the baby is coming and this baby is saying, ""I want this better life,"" and you want to give the baby a better life too. Who can support you, do you think when-when you look around who's in your circle right now, who do you think can support you in moving towards path B?
Client: Definitely my parents, um, and I probably need to, uh, go and meet some other-other people who are maybe, you know, having kids too so that I can see, like how it's done 'cause like, I only have a younger brother who's like not-not even close to that. So I don't really have anyone in my life that I know that's had kids recently. So I-I would like to meet other, you know, young moms out there who, you know, are kind of struggling with the same stuff I am.
Therapist: And your parents are a support for you and support you from giving up the drinking, the alcohol use, that's something that they would support-
Client: I don't think they realize, uh, that I'm doing it or how much I'm doing it.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And I know that if they found out, they would be really pissed.
Therapist: That would be a concern for them as well as for you now.

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: Uh, welcome. And, uh—
Client: Thank you.
Therapist: I'd say my name is Mark and I work here at Green Prescriptions. And-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: I know a little bit about you from the referral letter from the doctor.
Client: From my GP?
Therapist: From your GP, yeah.
Client: Uh.
Therapist: But before we get to anything, I'll probably want to just ask you a little bit about what's led you to come here today and get a bit of an idea about what's been going on for you.
Client: What's led me to come here?
Therapist: Mm.
Client: My GP.
Therapist: And what did he have to say?
Client: Well, um, you know, I had my sort of, uh, checkup.
Therapist: mm.
Client: And it revealed that apparently, I might have diabetes 2. Well, that's what he says.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Um, I-I think that I feel perfectly well. I-I'm, you know-- I understand people with diabetes are a little bit plumper than I am.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: But, um, that's really why I'm here. I'm on his command, almost.
Therapist: Right, so he kinda gave you a directive?
Client: Well, he did. He says he's going to put me on some sort of program if it gets worse.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: But as I say, I-I feel absolutely fine now.
Therapist: So it kind of came a bit of a surprise, you feeling okay.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: You go for this checkup with the doctor. And he says, ""You've got Type II diabetes.""
Client: Mm, I'm very surprised.
Therapist: Mm. Came out of the blue for you?
Client: Yes. I think it did.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: And you said you kind of don't fit that kinda Type II diabetes look. That you kinda have had this idea-
Client: I-
Therapist: -you've been-been overweight with it.
Client: That's what I understand.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: You know, and I'm not overweight.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I-I sort of look after myself to a limited extent in that way. Um, but I'm a busy person, I suppose I burn off the calories. And-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I don't know, really.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: My lifestyle—
Therapist: Hmm. So it doesn't quite fit in your head, Type II diabetes and-
Client: No.
Therapist: -your lifestyle?
Client: No, not at all.
Therapist: Comes as a big surprise. And what was your reaction when he told you that at the time?
Client: Well, I-I thought he must be joking. To be honest. I thought-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -you know, why you are-- Look around you.
Therapist: Mm, mm.
Client: um, I just felt that, um-- I mean, I don't think he was wasting my time because why would he do that?
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: Right?
Therapist: He's got a lot to do.
Client: Um-- Absolutely right.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: He's got a job to do. And obviously, the tests have come through. And I have got these signs of diabetes 2.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Right? Um, I just think that-- Well, I just don't feel like it, Mark.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Um—
Therapist: So how are you feel in your head-
Client: I feel absolutely fine.
Therapist: -and what the tests say kind of like don't join up.
Client: Yeah. Well, physically, I feel absolutely fine.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I'm-I'm-- I didn't see anything wrong with me at all.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: I mean, I get around, I sleep pretty well-
Therapist: Hmm-hmm.
Client: I sort of you know-
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: - I'm-I'm compos mentis. So I don't—
Therapist: Yeah. What's the problem? Mm.
Client: What is the problem?
Therapist: And how did this happen is probably kind of what you're also thinking. Well, how did this--?
Client: Well, uh, yes. I mean-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -I must admit, I haven't done too much research. I've been a bit busy.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Um, but he-he was saying something about, I don't know, family or whatever. I don't know.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And I don't know if it's hereditary.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I think he said something about it being hereditary.
Therapist: So he mentioned, it might be a family thing. And so you-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -maybe got from your parents or something of the sort.
Client: Yeah, it could be-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -because, um, my mother mentioned-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -that, uh, my father had diabetes-
Therapist: Right.
Client: -diabetes 2. And if I think about it, um, his brother-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -uh, I haven't seen him for years.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But he might well have it because he is-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -a pretty cuddly guy. You know-
Therapist: Right.
Client: He's pretty big.
Therapist: So he fits the picture-
Client: Well, yes, the stereotype,-
Therapist: -when you think about what he-he-- Yeah, he's stereotypical.
Client: Yeah, I guess.
Therapist: A little bit bigger, perhaps doesn't look after himself that well, and he fits that foot
Client: Well, yeah. I mean, as far as I know, I hadn't seen him for-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -I don't know how many years.
Therapist: Mm. So you got this knowledge as a witness there's some family history of diabetes in the past?
Client: Apparently so. Yes, apparently so.
Therapist: Doctor mentioned that as being a factor.
Client: Mm, I mean, it is hereditary, is it?
Therapist: That's certainly true. Yes. We know that people who've had parents or have been in the past, there is a hereditary factor or genetic factor in-involved.
Client: A genetic factor. And so, does that mean that if you've got, um, if you've got a history of this within your family-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -if it's a gene-- you are more likely than not to get it?
Therapist: Correct. Yeah.
Client: Also, it's—
Therapist: But it's not inevitable.
Client: Right. Okay.
Therapist: Because its genes or the-the-the-the hereditary factor is not the only factor that causes it or is involved in it happening to you. So there's other factors that come into play.
Client: I'm sure you're going to tell me what they are.
Therapist: Well, you've-you've mentioned some of the things you know, and one of those is hereditary factors. You mentioned that the doctor mentioned that. And what else do you know or have you heard? You say you haven't had a lot of time to do the research. What else? Other things you've.
Client: To be frank, Mark, I honestly don't know. I mean, I honestly don't know what causes it because I've never had any reason. It came upon me from the GP and it took me back.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, the hereditary thing I thought, well, maybe that's the explanation.
Therapist: That makes a bit of sense.
Client: And why go any further, it's there?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Can't help it.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: They live pretty long lives, they did, all right.
Therapist: They managed with it.
Client: Relatives relatively went into their 70s.
Therapist: Okay. I don't know if it'd be helpful for you if you'd like to know a little bit more about some of the factors involved in time Type II diabetes.
Client: Well.
Therapist: If that would help.
Client: If there's something that you think that-- Yes. Yes, of course.
Therapist: Well, I'll perhaps share with you what I know from working with other people and some of the things I've experienced in working with people.
Client: Okay.
Therapist: And see what you make of it. See if it fits a little bit more with where you're at. We know that there is a strong family factor or hereditary factor, so that's one aspect. So also it tends to happen a little bit later in life, rather than something you might get when you're a teenager, this type of diabetes. So-so it's a later onset. It takes a bit of time for it to develop maybe. And the main reason I think, um, the main aspect of it is that it, have you heard about insulin.
Client: I've heard of it yeah.
Therapist: So that's a hormone or a chemical, it allows you to utilize sugar in your body.
Client: Right.
Therapist: All right. And Type II diabetes typically people have a resistance or a resistance to insulin in their cells, in their fat cells or their muscle cells or liver cells. They can't use insulin. And so sugar builds up in your system.
Client: Are you saying that they-they like they can't digest insulin or is that?
Therapist: You need insulin in your cells, individual cells in muscle or in fat or wherever to, um, use up excess sugar or to utilize sugar.
Client: Oh, I see. So-so it's like a-it's like a balance.
Therapist: That's right.
Client: So insulin you-you.
Therapist: Kind of, as your.
Client: You have yourself draws bar.
Therapist: Yap.
Client: Or something, and then what balances that out in the body is the insulin taking off the excess.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Or-or digesting? Should I say the excessive sugars?
Therapist: That's a good way to think.
Client: Is that what happened?
Therapist: Exactly. And what's happening in Type II diabetes is your-your fat cells and liver cells and muscle cells are resistant to insulin. It's almost like they're saying we can't use that.
Client: Why?
Therapist: And if-- Well, there's a number of-- We're not entirely sure, there's a lot of research still going on as to how this happens and how that could be modified. But what we do know is that, um, one of the key things in managing it is to try and modify or modulate, control the amount of sugar that are in your system.
Client: Right. Okay.
Therapist: Yeah. So there's a couple of things that we know that people with Type II diabetes have to look after and have to think about if they want to control the amount of sugar that's in their system, which is the main issue that's causing some of the health problems that people have with Type II diabetes. Too much sugar, and if it's not able to be utilized in the blood cell, in the fat cells, or liver cells, and the muscle cells stays in your bloodstream. And that can cause problems with your circulation. So too high blood sugar and too low a blood sugar can be a problem. So sugar is the main concern in Type II- Type II diabetes.And you mentioned earlier on, a couple of things that the doctor-- You've mentioned some signs that he was kind of a little bit concerned about. Well, what things did you notice over the-over the last month or so?
Client: You mean, personally?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Well, I didn't know. I mean, the thing is you see that-- I mean, I did think about this a little bit and I thought, well, over time, if things happen slowly, you don't really notice.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: As you get older.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I don't-I don't leap over five bar gates like I used to, you know, um, as opposed to, uh, running with the backs now, I tend to spend more time, you know, with my old mates in the bar.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: At the rugby club and-and-and the such like, yeah. And, um, the fish I'm hooking, I'm not after the kings anymore, I go for the snapper now, it's a bit easier, you know.
Therapist: A slightly more sedate lifestyle.
Client: Yeah, absolutely. You just do.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: You just do. Um, so you're less demanding, I guess, on your-on your body, you realize, and you don't really want to do these things anyway. You know, you let the youngsters get home.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Been there, done that. So you don't really notice. So I'm coming back to this diagnosis I had from my GP and him saying, ""You've got diabetes 2,"" well, I should feel like that, shouldn't I?
Therapist: Yeah. It should feel like there's something really wrong with you.
Client: Yeah, I mean.
Therapist: What's-how have you been feeling over the last month? So, you say you're very busy you're doing a lot of work.
Client: Yeah, I mean I'm a busy person. All right? I uh, my work uh, I work in insurance, so I'm always hopping from one place to another place.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, I haven't noticed.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: I really haven't noticed how, um, okay I get a bit--I suppose I get a bit out of breath sometimes.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: If I rush too much that-that's true. Um, I suppose, um, I don't go upstairs two at a time anymore, I use one at a time.
Therapist: So a little bit sort of energy is not quite there sometimes? The vitality.
Client: Oh, certainly the energy I have is-is not what I-what I had. I mean I do need to, you know, I'm busy but I do need to sit down, um, uh, I do need to sit down and relax with a cup of coffee, you know, and, uh, things.
Therapist: Yeah, Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, more than I would normally.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But that would be, that would be about it.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, is it getting worse? I don't know. I-I-I suppose. What worse? Is it-is it increasing? Well, to say, I don't really notice it.
Therapist: You haven't noticed it. So it's a progressive, you know, you've just seen this, as-as you got older, things have slowed down. You know those activities you used to do, but that's kind of like what happens.
Client: Yeah, yeah. Um, at least, that's what I think. I mean I don't know if you're telling me that I should be more active or my GP is saying I should be more active.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, as I say, uh, you know I-I don't do any regular form of exercise, I have to say, not anymore.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: But maybe I-maybe I don't know.
Therapist: Hmm, a bit of a mystery there.
Client: I mean I've got uh, well I-I mean I've got a great lifestyle. I mean if it's very-it-it's very good. I mean I've got all my mates in down at the rugby club. And I've got uh, you know even in the summer when that's a bit damn. I used to coach rugby and I coached cricket when I finished playing. So-so I've got the-the guys in the cricket club, um, you know, for the-for the, uh, for the summer evenings. And, uh, and then, uh, the-then, of course, we've got the fishing, and that's all of us combined. We're a big gang, really.
Therapist: Really? So what I'm hearing is there's actually a lot of aspects in your life which are really good.
Client: Oh, I think my life yeah. My life is great.
Therapist: From your perspective, things are going well?
Client: My life is great, and then you turn around and say, ""Hey you've got-- you-you're ill, you're sick.
Therapist: Yeah. It doesn't fit.
Client: And um, no I'm not. But you see, he said to me that he's gonna put me on some sort of, uh, a daily monitoring of, is it sugar levels?
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: And I'm gonna have to take regular pills.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Well frankly, the only pills I take are sort of paracetamols.
Therapist: Yeah. When you get uh, a headache.
Client: For a bit of the head in the morning, you know.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um.
Therapist: So the idea of having to test-test your blood sugar and take medications is kinda like off--
Client: Come on, you know.
Therapist: And you know that's a bit too-
Client: Well, life is too short.
Therapist: Too much.
Client: You know it's the truth.
Therapist: Yeah. Okay.
Client: I mean you know—
Therapist: And you're here today and that's probably something in you you've thought well I'll follow this through, you know I'll-I'll come along and see what-see what they've got to say. And I'm just wondering for this session, for the time we have today, there's a number of things we could talk about. You mentioned a couple of things about your lifestyle and, um, medication is one thing you've been told by the doctor you might need to do that. And a number of things that we could talk about today. Which-which area would you think would be useful for you to focus on?
Client: Well there is-there is something that you sort of prompted me to think about, and, um, I split up-- My wife and I, we split up several years ago now. And, um, you know we've been married for many many years.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: And um, I think she used to look after me because she used to do the cooking and-and-and stuff like that.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And I have to say that I'm not the best cook in the world.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, and-and being on the run all the time and you know once I get back home, it's, you know, it's time to go down to the rugby club or whatever it might be, uh, we're out with the mates. And, uh, I-I do I suppose my food is not as healthy perhaps as it used to be when she was around. She's moved down to Hamilton to live with her mother, if you've met her mother. Anyway, but, um.
Therapist: So then, since you've been on your own since you've separated, divorced and you've noticed that the things you eat and how you eat has changed.
Client: Yeah, I mean mates and their wives are pretty cool about it sometimes.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Because, you know, they'll invite me for dinner and so on.
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: And, yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess, you know, that's when you, well, or whatever reason, you split up in life.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You start looking at the home life of somebody else, you're thinking, ""Hmm, I use d to have this.""
Therapist: Hmm. Yeah, yeah.
Client: And you think, "" This is nice food, "" isn't it? and you know.
Therapist: Yeah. And your-- part of your wife used to do a lot of that for you?
Client: Oh, she would do all the cooking. Yeah, yeah,
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I never bothered to boil an egg in the water, you know.
Therapist: And so she would kinda look after what you ate and healthy things that you had, spread in front of you and off you go.
Client: Totally. I mean, I was just in charge of the wine, you know.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. And now you have to think about what you might eat and sometimes you don't eat the best.
Client: Well I-- This is what I'm saying. Maybe I'm not thinking about it. Maybe that's the thing.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Maybe I'm just—
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You know, because it-- you know this-- the pizza shop's just on the road.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And then there's-- I mean, okay, I confess that lunchtime, occasionally, it's uh, I'm hungry and McDonald's is very convenient
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -or Kentucky Fried or whatever.
Therapist: Very appealing, isn't it?
Client: You know, it's very easy. and then, um, then you think to yourself, well-- I mean, I do think of myself that maybe I should have a few vegetables around here or whatever. But then you go out into the supermarkets, you know, and you can pick up, uh, your- one of your TV dinners.
Therapist: Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm.
Client: So you bring those in and you open them up and put them in the microwave and there's vegetables there.
Therapist: Yeah they look pretty good on the plate, don't they?
Client: Yeah, it looks- it looks fine, you know, et cetera. I mean, so that will happen occasionally if I've got a night in. But cooking-wise, no, I haven't cooked anything, um, other than boil the water for the kettle for a cup o coffee.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -for ages.
Therapist: They're food choices in what you eat and what's in your diet it's not what-something you actually you've actually been aware of or had to think about in the past.
Client: Yeah. I do miss her breakfast. I have to say, we used to have get a nice breakfast.
Therapist: So one thing that you noticed is diet and the eating patterns and-
Client: Well—
Therapist: -when you eat. That's one aspect. What other aspects do you think you've-- you would be--?
Client: Well, I used to be quite a heavy smoker, right? I mean, I'd smoke a pack in a half a day. And I knew that wasn't doing me any good.
Therapist: Right.
Client: I mean the thing is when you're a-- I mean, I've always smoked. So, but when you're young and you're a sportsman, you know—
Therapist: You kinda juggle those two things and kinda--
Client: Well, the two things they balance out, you know and everybody else is
Therapist: You still run and have a cigarette?
Client: You know, you pass a cigarette down the backline almost, don't you? You know, just before the game gets—
Therapist: Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, part of the culture.
Client: Yeah, part of the of the whole thing. And it's changed a bit now, because in my day when we were playing, of course, it was a very much more of a social game, which was spent-spent in the rugby club.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: That's why you played and it was a big buddy-buddy thing.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: That was rugby and cricket was the same really.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Um, but now—
Therapist: But over the years, you've actually reduced your smoking or you've stopped altogether or at times?
Client: Well I-I, yeah. I was getting a bit sort of-- I was getting a bit, you know, a bit wheezy and I thought, ""I'll cut this out.""
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: But I enjoy smoking. I really do enjoy it. So I cut it down to I suppose it's about 10 a day now.
Therapist: Okay, so you meant to reduce.
Client: Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: You were noticing that it's having an impact on your breathing and health wasn't so good.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: When you related that to your smoking, so you managed to reduce your smoking.
Client: Yeah, yeah. I sort of—
Therapist: So you've made our decision to do that?
Client: it-it-it's-- you know, she will, ""Why don't you give up? You've gone so far, why don't you just stop?"" But I don't want to.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: It's-it's-- I-I enjoy it, um—
Therapist: Yeah, and it's hard to get to stop something you enjoy, isn't it?
Client: Well, yeah. I mean, you know, the thing is that you get to, you know, you've got to-- when you get down to that, you, uh, you have to regulate sort of-
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You know, you have to be quite strong-willed about, I suppose, in a way.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: So you say, ""Okay, well, you don't have a cigarette unless you have a cup of coffee. [laughs]
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know.
Therapist: But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?
Client: Oh, yeah, yeah. I have two sugars. A couple of sugar in coffee. Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: So we cut that down as I say.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: But the problem goes that coffee, we're up to 8 or so, 10 cups of coffee a day now.
Therapist: You're drinking more coffee. So what I've heard you say so far is, if I can just start right back from the beginning and you used to come in and sais, ""I went to the doctor."" You went for-- it sounds like you went for just a checkup.
Client: No, you know, there's a friend of mine, one of the guys down the rugby club, he said- he said, ""I'm going for my annual, you know-
Therapist: MIT.
Client: -warranty of fitness, sort of thing, you know. And I thought, now that's an idea, not been to one of those.
Therapist: Got to check out, why not?
Client: So I'm 55, and you read in the papers, you know, it's that at 55 you will-- you know, heart disease is more prevalent
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: -and all these sorts of things that you get around this middle-age time. So I thought, ""Well, I'll go and have one."" And frankly, when I went along, I was very confident. I thought, you know, the doctor is going to saying, ""Hmm, I wish I was as healthy as you,"" sort of thing.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, but unfortunately, uh, he-he came up with this. And it's the only thing I think he really came up with. I think-
Therapist: So everything else looked pretty good?
Client: My cholesterol is quite good, not too bad.
Therapist: Cholesterol good, your weight is good.
Client: Yeah-yeah. Not too bad.
Therapist: Um, you are smoking, but you've managed to reduce that.
Client: Well, yeah, I've cut it down, yeah. I mean, that's been three years, mind.
Therapist: And anything else, you know, you go ticking down the list. The tire is good, oil good.
Client: Absolutely.
Therapist: So we're looking good.
Client: And then we come to this-
Therapist: And ah, hang on.
Client: -too much sugar in the tank, or something. I don't know.
Therapist: Yeah, there's something wrong with the, uh, with this bit.
Client: So, yeah.
Therapist: And it doesn't quite fit with how you see your own lifestyle.
Client: No.
Therapist: Because you've-- it sounds like what you've been doing, you've made some conscious effort to be aware of some of those things you might think are important.
Client: I mean, yeah. I mean, you know, the thing is, you see, the thing is, and I mean, and probably you've-- I think you've heard this before, but people, they turn around, oh, uh, you know, doom and gloom prophets, you shouldn't drink.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: You shouldn't smoke.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And then I think to myself, ""Well, maybe I shouldn't socialize."" And then after that, ""Well, maybe I shouldn't be alive.""
Therapist: So like a domino effect, and they'll all be just sitting-
Client: You know. I mean, what-what-what's going on here? This is- this is- this is so many people's lives.
Therapist: Mm-hm.
Client: And um, I suppose, you know, if it came down to it, then, and somebody said, ""Well, you can solve this problem by taking a pill once a day, um, you know, it will keep it down, and there will be no problems,"" Then I-I could go with that. But what I don't want to do, um, the doctor was saying, or insinuating, that I'd have to change my lifestyle.
Therapist: A bit broad kind of like you've gotta change everything.
Client: Yeah. It was um, and I-I said, well, no. I'm sorry. [coughs] I'm not going to change my lifestyle. I've got to where I am. I'm reasonably happy. Okay, I wish I wasn't separated. Okay, I wish my kids were-were still around, um, you know. One of them is off now in, um, in-- back in Europe playing rugby in France.
Therapist: Yeah. And your thought was, yeah, right, I hear that, but actually, I don't want to make all these big changes in my life.
Client: No, I don't want to, because I don't feel that I need to.
Therapist: Feel like you need to. Yeah.
Client: I mean, it's you know, why?
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Um, I can't argue with a medical professional, Mark, because I know nothing, you know.
Therapist: The test, is the test, and experience, yeah.
Client: So, I mean, what-what-what-what suggestions would you have? I mean, what-what sort of-
Therapist: I don't know. I think it's up to you where we start, and that's the question I've got in my mind. You've mentioned a couple of things that you've already made some effort, or been conscious of. You've mentioned the diet, you've mentioned your smoking, those are two quite important aspects that we often talk about here in how people work.
Client: Is smoking related to diabetes then?
Therapist: It can have an impact, yes. So smoking, um, affects your blood system, so it hardens the arteries, um, and over time, it can have a significant impact on the healing of wounds. So people with Type II diabetes, often, if they get a cut, or a bruise, or something, it takes a long time to heal. Smoking reduces the amount of oxygen in your system, so that can further, you know, limit the time it takes your body to heal.
Client: Oh.
Therapist: So we know that smoking and Type II diabetes together-
Client: Don't help.
Therapist: -isn't a good combination.
Client: Is it okay if you have one without the other? I'm sorry, it's a silly question. [laughs]
Therapist: Well, the question is, I suppose, that I have for you is, where would you think, for you, would be a good place to start? If you were gonna make any changes, even small changes at the beginning, rather than just thinking, oh, I got to change everything, which it sounds like you're not prepared to, you know, do a whole lifestyle change, and I don't think that's what we're talking about here. Where would you feel most comfortable to start if you were gonna make any changes at all?
Client: Where would I start? Well, I-- What if about if I cut down on sugar in the coffee? If we could have long blacks, no milk, and no sugar.
Therapist: Yeah. Hmm, that might be a start.
Client: I think I could- I think I could probably handle that.
Therapist: Hm. What we also find is that people make these little changes, small changes, and that starts to kind of well, it makes them-
Client: Something of a rollover effect.
Therapist: -rollover, the domino effect starts to happen, and they start looking at other aspects.
Client: Domino effect, yeah.
Therapist: So rather than thinking, ""oh, my God, I have to change all these things. I've gotta stop smoking, I've gotta exercise more, I've gotta, you know, start eating more fruit and vegetables,"" you might start with these small changes, and then-
Client: I mean, how much exercise should I do a week?
Therapist: Um, I-I'm reluctant to give a prescription for that because I think it's really up to you. And I think it depends on how things go, as to how much you need to do.
Client: Right.
Therapist: You mentioned earlier on, the doctors talking about you monitoring your blood sugar.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So on how-- It depends on how-how that goes. Let's say, if you started doing that and you do some more exercise, you start to have longer blacks, rather than short blacks with lots of sugar. And you get down the sugar and you find your blood sugar starts to come down, then we're heading in the right direction.
Client: Okay, so—
Therapist: So it's really, I suppose, up to how things go for you, and you get that feedback. And if that's going in the right direction, you carry on doing and do some more of that.
Client: So, a-are we saying then that-that, really all I need to do, for this moment, is I can forget about everything, but cut out the sugar, uh, in the coffee and the milk-- I don't know, but you might as well, you know, milk without sugar is silly. But, um, if we do that, is that where we start?
Therapist: I think where we start is where you feel comfortable starting.
Client: Well, I mean that's something that's not difficult to do.
Therapist: Apples for breakfast.
Client: You start off at breakfast and get yourself an apple, a bit-a bit of apple and-and so on. Um—
Therapist: So what I'm hearing you're kind of saying is, that there's-- You're now starting to think of some very useful little starting points.

Return ""simple"", ""complex"" or ""none"" based on whether the last therapist's utterance  has a simple, complex or no reflection. 
Feel free to return none as the therapist utterance might not have any reflection.

Here are a few examples.

Examples:

Example 1
Client: But-but the wheezing is something that I've definitely noticed a little bit.
Therapist: I guess I also wonder whether, regardless of-of if your asthma symptoms are connected to Oscar, that may be part of you feels like it's worth it because he's been-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: -such a big part of your life for so long.
Answer: complex

Example 2
Client: Um, I'm just- yeah I just like to have a few drinks. I mean, you know, obviously, I-I have, uh, this diagnosed condition, and-and I think, you know, if I were able to, you know, maybe take a few hits off of the joint and have a couple of beers, I think that's about the same as taking the medicine.
Therapist: Well, you know, what, I-- There are a lot of people that wouldn't disagree with you on that exactly. You know, so, um, uh, but I know that they-they were never quite sure how they were all interacting all together. Like the, um- the weed kind of tends to make people a little paranoid anyway.
Client: Yeah, I-I-I got to be careful with it. If I take more than a hit or two of it, it-it-it can be a bit of a problem.
Therapist: Yeah. Why, what happens if you take a little too much of it?
Answer: none

Example 3
Client: That's a good way to sum it up. And it's-- Well, you understand it, uh, it's just- it's not good.
Therapist: Mm. So, and then you said, you don't like how it makes you act, um, if you can tell me a little bit about that.
Answer: simple

Example 4
Client: Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know.
Therapist: But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?
Answer: complex

Example 5
Client: I wanna stay friends with them. I don't want- I don't want them to just-
Therapist: You don't wanna lose your support group, yeah. You just wanna them to support you in being healthy, while helping them, raising the babe, and so we're just taking path B. You don't wanna lose them, just maybe the lifestyle it sounds like.
Answer: none

Example 6
Client: Um, I mean, I guess- I guess I need some strategies for figuring out how to ease stress without, I guess, getting high.
Therapist: Okay. And that's a very good reason for being here. Um, can you talk to me about maybe some of your-- the goals that you have?
Answer: none

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: Thank you for coming in to see me today, Nina. I'm looking forward to getting to know you a little bit and hearing a little bit about you and what brought you in here today.
Client: Um, my doctor referred me. He said I had to come because I've- I've been a little irresponsible with this pregnancy. Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. He's thinking you were a little irresponsible.
Client: Yeah. Um, he said that I was drinking too much with it. Um, I-I haven't been a lot, but he said it was still maybe, um, would screw things up.
Therapist: And you're feeling kind of concerned about that.
Client: Yeah. Yeah. Like I don't- I don't want to screw anything up with this baby, but, um, yeah, I'm just- I'm scared I already did.
Therapist: Okay. So, you're concerned about the consequences, and you really care about your baby, and you want to give your baby the best start you can.
Client: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Therapist: And you're wondering a little bit about this time that we're going to spend together.
Client: Yeah. He didn't really tell me what to expect. He just said, ""Go- go see her as well.""
Therapist: So here you are today and, um, you're sharing that you have been drinking alcohol throughout your pregnancy.
Client: Yeah. Um, I didn't find out I was pregnant until probably two-ish months in-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -and I had already been drinking then. Um, I've been really trying not to, but, you know, weekends come around, and, um, all my friends are kind of partying and stuff, and it's been hard to, like, break that habit.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. So, there's this external pressure coming from the people you care about to sort of stay in the scene.
Client: A little bit. I think if I- if I talk to them, it would be fine, but it's-it's weird, right? Like I'm the only one of my friends that's, like, taking this step and having a kid, and they don't really know how to handle that.
Therapist: Kind of feels like You're between two worlds. In one world, you're preparing to be a mother and bring a baby into this world, and this other world is the world that you've been in for a while where you're kind of having a good time and-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -drinking and your friends are-
Client: Yeah, like, I'm- I'm still, like, I'm only in my 20s, and-and for everyone else, it's like, ""Okay, it's party time,"" and now I kind of have to, like, break out of that.
Therapist: Okay. So, this party-time world's- are you feeling like this is something you want to move out of and move into that mom world? Or does it feel like I want to hang out there still too?
Client: There's, yeah, there's part of me that still wants to live that out because I'm not going to have another chance, like once this kid comes, it's-it's going to be over. I know I'm gonna- I know I'm going to have to change.
Therapist: So, for you, you're feeling like once the baby comes and actually in your arms, then things are going to change, but right now, while you're pregnant, you're thinking, ""I can kind of hang out in both worlds a little bit,"" but part of you may be thinking maybe that's not the case. It's time to go to the mom world maybe.
Client: Yeah. Probably. And I'm also feeling like it's too late. I already screwed it up.
Therapist: Okay. So, you've got a lot of concerns about what's happened to- up until this point, as far as your drinking. What do you know about, um, drinking alcohol throughout pregnancy?
Client: Well, I know, like, they say not to, but I thought because my friends didn't really care, I thought, ""Okay. Like maybe-maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe it's just what they tell you."" Just like drinking, in general, is bad.
Therapist: So, you were thinking because your-your friends weren't pressuring you to stop drinking, that-that it must be okay.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And then there's this other part of you that's- was thinking maybe it's not okay.
Client: Yeah, like, I should probably have trusted my gut.
Therapist: So, your gut is telling you what? Tell me about that.
Client: It's telling me that what I'm doing is wrong and it's probably hurting my kid and that- that I'm gonna really regret that once I actually get my kid.
Therapist: And you really wanna do what's best for your babe. And kind of wondering, um, how to move forward from here, is that where you wanna, you know, kind of focus in on, or what are your thoughts about giving up drinking altogether?
Client: Um, I'm definitely it's not-- I think I could probably do it. It's just- it-it comes hard when you're, like, in that moment. You're around your friends and they're drinking and you don't wanna be- you don't wanna be the mom at that moment. You wanna be yourself. You wanna be who you were before.
Therapist: So, you kind of have this identity, dual identity going on. I wanna be that person, yet, that person-
Client: And so many people, when they have kids, they just vanish from their friends. And I don't wanna be that person. I don't wanna be that person that just has a kid and they're completely-completely different.
Therapist: Mm. So, embraces this life of the picket fence and the, you know, the little house and having the baby in this-
Client: Yeah, suburbs. Yeah.
Therapist: So, you don't wanna be that- that- that woman that's just sort of living in this house with the baby carriage, and at the same time, that world's kind of saying it's behind you.
Client: Yeah, I-I guess. Like, I don't wanna- I don't wanna lose my friends because of this. And I don't wanna put pressure on them to change because they're, I mean, they're good people. They're just—
Therapist: You care about them.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: It's just the scene that they're-they're still in because their life maybe hasn't taken that change that your life has made. And so now, you're here and you're not sure. You want the baby, but you're not sure about the suburbs and the picket fence thing. You're not sure—

Therapist: Well, you know, what, I-- There are a lot of people that wouldn't disagree with you on that exactly. You know, so, um, uh, but I know that they-they were never quite sure how they were all interacting all together. Like the, um- the weed kind of tends to make people a little paranoid anyway.
Client: Yeah, I-I-I got to be careful with it. If I take more than a hit or two of it, it-it-it can be a bit of a problem.
Therapist: Yeah. Why, what happens if you take a little too much of it?
Answer: none

Client: That's a good way to sum it up. And it's-- Well, you understand it, uh, it's just- it's not good.
Therapist: Mm. So, and then you said, you don't like how it makes you act, um, if you can tell me a little bit about that.

Client: Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know.
Therapist: But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?
Answer: complex

Example 5
Client: I wanna stay friends with them. I don't want- I don't want them to just-
Therapist: You don't wanna lose your support group, yeah. You just wanna them to support you in being healthy, while helping them, raising the babe, and so we're just taking path B. You don't wanna lose them, just maybe the lifestyle it sounds like.
Answer: none

Example 6
Client: Um, I mean, I guess- I guess I need some strategies for figuring out how to ease stress without, I guess, getting high.
Therapist: Okay. And that's a very good reason for being here. Um, can you talk to me about maybe some of your-- the goals that you have?
Answer: none

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: So there are a lot of different directions that we could take. Um, you've mentioned wanting to make changes in your physical activity. You've mentioned wanting to make changes in your eating habits and also just wanting more body confidence. Um, what- what's on your mind is as far as a- as a change topic for the rest of our session today?
Client: I think the activity piece is the kind of low-hanging fruit that I see. Um, I feel like it's gonna be harder for me to change some of my nutrition habits right out the gate, but if I can get into maybe an activity routine, that that could be good to help maybe some of the other changes happen later.
Therapist: Yeah. Okay. So physical activity is feeling like the easiest change to look at first.
Client: Yeah, I think so.
Therapist: Great. So tell me a little bit more about your motivators for getting started in being more physically active. I know you shared energy levels and I know you've shared, um, that you'd like to see a boost in your mood and feeling less irritable and stressed. Any other benefits that really make you wanna make this change right now?
Client: Yeah, I think just to feeling like physically stronger, um, like physically more able. Uh, last night I like struggled with the jar of salsa, like opening it. So I think that just stuff like that, um, you know, would be in addition to mood and being more productive and energy and all that stuff. Um, yeah, that that would be a definite end goal for me too. And then really to like, I think if I am more active, I think my body image or my body confidence would improve also.
Therapist: Yeah. So you're wanting to feel stronger so that you can open jars and other things and- and also just have a better sense of confidence.
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: Great. So on a scale from zero to 10, zero being not at all ready to make a change in the area of physical activity, and 10 being let's- let's do this. I'm excited. I'm ready. Um, where- where do you fall on that scale?
Client: Hmm, I'd say I'm about an eight.
Therapist: Okay. So you're- you're feeling fairly motivated.

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: Thank you for coming in to see me today, Nina. I'm looking forward to getting to know you a little bit and hearing a little bit about you and what brought you in here today.
Client: Um, my doctor referred me. He said I had to come because I've- I've been a little irresponsible with this pregnancy. Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. He's thinking you were a little irresponsible.
Client: Yeah. Um, he said that I was drinking too much with it. Um, I-I haven't been a lot, but he said it was still maybe, um, would screw things up.
Therapist: And you're feeling kind of concerned about that.
Client: Yeah. Yeah. Like I don't- I don't want to screw anything up with this baby, but, um, yeah, I'm just- I'm scared I already did.
Therapist: Okay. So, you're concerned about the consequences, and you really care about your baby, and you want to give your baby the best start you can.
Client: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Therapist: And you're wondering a little bit about this time that we're going to spend together.
Client: Yeah. He didn't really tell me what to expect. He just said, ""Go- go see her as well.""
Therapist: So here you are today and, um, you're sharing that you have been drinking alcohol throughout your pregnancy.
Client: Yeah. Um, I didn't find out I was pregnant until probably two-ish months in-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -and I had already been drinking then. Um, I've been really trying not to, but, you know, weekends come around, and, um, all my friends are kind of partying and stuff, and it's been hard to, like, break that habit.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. So, there's this external pressure coming from the people you care about to sort of stay in the scene.
Client: A little bit. I think if I- if I talk to them, it would be fine, but it's-it's weird, right? Like I'm the only one of my friends that's, like, taking this step and having a kid, and they don't really know how to handle that.
Therapist: Kind of feels like You're between two worlds. In one world, you're preparing to be a mother and bring a baby into this world, and this other world is the world that you've been in for a while where you're kind of having a good time and-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -drinking and your friends are-
Client: Yeah, like, I'm- I'm still, like, I'm only in my 20s, and-and for everyone else, it's like, ""Okay, it's party time,"" and now I kind of have to, like, break out of that.
Therapist: Okay. So, this party-time world's- are you feeling like this is something you want to move out of and move into that mom world? Or does it feel like I want to hang out there still too?
Client: There's, yeah, there's part of me that still wants to live that out because I'm not going to have another chance, like once this kid comes, it's-it's going to be over. I know I'm gonna- I know I'm going to have to change.
Therapist: So, for you, you're feeling like once the baby comes and actually in your arms, then things are going to change, but right now, while you're pregnant, you're thinking, ""I can kind of hang out in both worlds a little bit,"" but part of you may be thinking maybe that's not the case. It's time to go to the mom world maybe.
Client: Yeah. Probably. And I'm also feeling like it's too late. I already screwed it up.
Therapist: Okay. So, you've got a lot of concerns about what's happened to- up until this point, as far as your drinking. What do you know about, um, drinking alcohol throughout pregnancy?
Client: Well, I know, like, they say not to, but I thought because my friends didn't really care, I thought, ""Okay. Like maybe-maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe it's just what they tell you."" Just like drinking, in general, is bad.
Therapist: So, you were thinking because your-your friends weren't pressuring you to stop drinking, that-that it must be okay.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And then there's this other part of you that's- was thinking maybe it's not okay.
Client: Yeah, like, I should probably have trusted my gut.
Therapist: So, your gut is telling you what? Tell me about that.
Client: It's telling me that what I'm doing is wrong and it's probably hurting my kid and that- that I'm gonna really regret that once I actually get my kid.
Therapist: And you really wanna do what's best for your babe. And kind of wondering, um, how to move forward from here, is that where you wanna, you know, kind of focus in on, or what are your thoughts about giving up drinking altogether?
Client: Um, I'm definitely it's not-- I think I could probably do it. It's just- it-it comes hard when you're, like, in that moment. You're around your friends and they're drinking and you don't wanna be- you don't wanna be the mom at that moment. You wanna be yourself. You wanna be who you were before.
Therapist: So, you kind of have this identity, dual identity going on. I wanna be that person, yet, that person-
Client: And so many people, when they have kids, they just vanish from their friends. And I don't wanna be that person. I don't wanna be that person that just has a kid and they're completely-completely different.
Therapist: Mm. So, embraces this life of the picket fence and the, you know, the little house and having the baby in this-
Client: Yeah, suburbs. Yeah.
Therapist: So, you don't wanna be that- that- that woman that's just sort of living in this house with the baby carriage, and at the same time, that world's kind of saying it's behind you.
Client: Yeah, I-I guess. Like, I don't wanna- I don't wanna lose my friends because of this. And I don't wanna put pressure on them to change because they're, I mean, they're good people. They're just—
Therapist: You care about them.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: It's just the scene that they're-they're still in because their life maybe hasn't taken that change that your life has made. And so now, you're here and you're not sure. You want the baby, but you're not sure about the suburbs and the picket fence thing. You're not sure—
Client: I don’t want that.
Therapist: You don't want that.
Client: No.
Therapist: You want this baby.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And you wanna be, um, take care of your baby as the baby's growing.
Client: Like, I wanna- I wanna be responsible for this thing.
Therapist: You don't wanna let your baby down.
Client: No.
Therapist: And at the same time, it's hard to let go of the past, but on the other hand, you're thinking, ""I don't have a choice. I've got to look this way."" Is that kind of what it feels like?
Client: I guess so. I feel like I've already made a choice and already made some bad choices with this.
Therapist: Nina, I'm wondering, what's your hope for the future? When you think about where you are today, um, what do you hope for when you look ahead?
Client: Well, I-I kept the kid because I wanted-- It was almost like that push, that sign for me to, like, move forward and become like an adult because it's scary, right? Like I-I still feel like a teenager sometimes. And having that push to be a real person is really-- It's a lot of pressure and I-I want to raise this kid well. I don't wanna- I don't wanna let my kid down. I don't wanna, you know, I don't wanna regret choosing to have this kid because I think it's the right time, but I don't wanna- I don't wanna make mistakes that make me realize maybe I'm not ready for this 'cause sometimes it feels like I'm not ready for this.
Therapist: You put your heart there that the baby is really- it was almost kind of like a sign for you that was saying, ""This baby is giving you a kind of a new chance at life, or giving you a plan B,"" and you guys both get to decide what plan B is gonna look like.
Client: Yeah, I just guess it's easier said than done though. Like, it's, like, great, I can make all these changes and I can be a completely new person, but it's, like, at the end of the day, I'm still just who I am.
Therapist: While this baby's growing in you and you think of all the opportunities that could come out of this, there's a part of you that says, ""I'm still that same girl that was drinking and partying,"" and-and maybe not living the life you wanted to live.
Client: Yeah. And I'm just- you know, you can't just one day flick a switch and become a new person.
Therapist: While this baby feels like this is your second chance, you're wondering, ""Do I deserve that second chance?"" And then this other part of you that says, ""Why not? It's here and I wanna go for it.""
Client: Yeah, I guess that voice is just a little more stifled by the other one.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. You got a lot of people around you that are kind of pulling it down, and it's kind of taking you back to the old life. And the baby is a constant reminder that there’s this new life ahead.
Client: Yeah, it's gonna be very different when it actually comes.
Therapist: When you think about, you know, embracing this new life, and taking that different path, turning away from path A and moving into path B, how confident are you that you can take path B and be successful in raising this baby, and letting go with the drinking and the life that you were in-in path A?
Client: I think I'm gonna have to be successful. I don't really- I don't have any other choice. Like I have to- I have to take that path.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. Tell me more about that, what makes you say, ""I have to take that path""? What makes you feel like you need that?
Client: Because I need to for my kid. It's- it's gonna be all screwed up if I don't.
Therapist: This part of you that says, ""I don't have an option to-to-to make this life better,"" it's wondering, ""Do I have the confidence to be able to make that life a reality?"" What do you think you need to increase your confidence that you can do this?
Client: I don't know, like, maybe- maybe actually talking to my friends and saying like- or maybe them actually being able to see this kid and go, ""Of course, of course, your- your choice makes sense. You--"" Maybe it would, you know, give them a wake-up call too if They actually, like, see it.
Therapist: So you're thinking that, um, once your friends see you with the baby in your arms that they too will see that there's a different path for them too?
Client: Or at least they'll feel less pressure to be who they want me to be.
Therapist: Mm, kind of feel like you're pulled between two worlds there.
Client: A little bit.
Therapist: It's not easy to be in that world and also having that constant reminder that the baby is coming and this baby is saying, ""I want this better life,"" and you want to give the baby a better life too. Who can support you, do you think when-when you look around who's in your circle right now, who do you think can support you in moving towards path B?
Client: Definitely my parents, um, and I probably need to, uh, go and meet some other-other people who are maybe, you know, having kids too so that I can see, like how it's done 'cause like, I only have a younger brother who's like not-not even close to that. So I don't really have anyone in my life that I know that's had kids recently. So I-I would like to meet other, you know, young moms out there who, you know, are kind of struggling with the same stuff I am.
Therapist: And your parents are a support for you and support you from giving up the drinking, the alcohol use, that's something that they would support-
Client: I don't think they realize, uh, that I'm doing it or how much I'm doing it.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And I know that if they found out, they would be really pissed.
Therapist: That would be a concern for them as well as for you now.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah. Is that something that, um, maybe you and I could meet again about-and talk about having those conversations with-with the family, maybe having conversations about, you know, the folks, your-your friends that are currently in the lifestyle that you were involved with, um, and then sort of what it would look like to go down path B, is that something that you would be open to meeting with me about again?
Client: I think so, yeah, like the telling my parents and [unintelligible 00:13:45] this to my parents is probably the scariest thing.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: And having to talk to those friends, like right now I don't want to do that. It's- it puts them in a weird place.
Therapist: Kind of feels like you're climbing Mt. Everest.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And you don't have equipment.
Client: It feels like I have to lec- I don't wanna have to lecture them and I don't want it to be like a lecture.
Therapist: You're concerned that they're gonna kind of treat you like a child.
Client: My parents or my friends?
Therapist: Oh, oh, you're talking about your friends.
Client: Yeah, lecture my-- Yeah.
Therapist: You're wondering if they're gonna kind of be like children and you're gonna be like the parent saying-
Client: Yeah, and I don't wanna be like that.
Therapist: You just wanna be like peers talking.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And you want them to support you.
Client: I wanna stay friends with them. I don't want- I don't want them to just-
Therapist: You don't wanna lose your support group, yeah. You just wanna them to support you in being healthy, while helping them, raising the babe, and so we're just taking path B. You don't wanna lose them, just maybe the lifestyle it sounds like.

Answer: complex

Example 5
Client: I wanna stay friends with them. I don't want- I don't want them to just-
Therapist: You don't wanna lose your support group, yeah. You just wanna them to support you in being healthy, while helping them, raising the babe, and so we're just taking path B. You don't wanna lose them, just maybe the lifestyle it sounds like.
Answer: none

Example 6
Client: Um, I mean, I guess- I guess I need some strategies for figuring out how to ease stress without, I guess, getting high.
Therapist: Okay. And that's a very good reason for being here. Um, can you talk to me about maybe some of your-- the goals that you have?
Answer: none

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Client: I don't know, I'm just having a lot of hard trouble trying to lose the rest of the weight. Um, right now, it's like no matter how much I try to exercise, run, or whatever, it doesn't matter like nothing else is coming off.
Therapist: Right, so you've hit a plateau in your weight and despite all the things that you're trying to do to increase your activity, it doesn't seem to be working on the scale?
Client: No, and I don't know what I'm doing wrong because I keep trying the exercise but nothing's happening.
Therapist: Right. So you feel like you're spinning your wheels, you're doing more exercising and it's not showing results on the scale?
Client: Yes.
Therapist: And you're not feeling so good about that?
Client: No, and even when I'm coming home, like, I'll go to the gym and then I'm noticing nothing is happening and I'll come home and I try to talk to my mama about it or even my father, and no one even cares about it. Like no one wants to support in it anyway.
Therapist: Uh, so you feel like you're doing this all alone?
Client: Yes.
Therapist: At home or you think that they'll be supportive but they're not giving- they're not giving you what you need?

Client: But-but the wheezing is something that I've definitely noticed a little bit.
Therapist: I guess I also wonder whether, regardless of-of if your asthma symptoms are connected to Oscar, that may be part of you feels like it's worth it because he's been-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: -such a big part of your life for so long.
Answer: complex

Example 2
Client: Um, I'm just- yeah I just like to have a few drinks. I mean, you know, obviously, I-I have, uh, this diagnosed condition, and-and I think, you know, if I were able to, you know, maybe take a few hits off of the joint and have a couple of beers, I think that's about the same as taking the medicine.
Therapist: Well, you know, what, I-- There are a lot of people that wouldn't disagree with you on that exactly. You know, so, um, uh, but I know that they-they were never quite sure how they were all interacting all together. Like the, um- the weed kind of tends to make people a little paranoid anyway.
Client: Yeah, I-I-I got to be careful with it. If I take more than a hit or two of it, it-it-it can be a bit of a problem.

Answer: none

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: So, you've got this dream by the sounds of it, which is, you know, to have a partner, and a house, and a nice car-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -so don't forget the nice car, and some kids, and be a- be a good dad-
Client: Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: -to your kids. So, is this dream starting to-- I am getting a picture of?
Client: Yeah, it'd be good.
Therapist: Yeah. Okay. So, what I'm really interested in is how offending fits in with that picture, that dream.
Client: I guess it doesn't.
Therapist: Yeah, how doesn't it fit, Billy?
Client: Uh, I guess I have to keep coming-coming back here and go into court and stuff.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah. It kinda messes things up.
Therapist: Yeah. It kinda messes up that dream, that picture?
Client: Yeah. It makes it harder.
Therapist: Mm. Makes it harder? Yeah. Well, it can make it harder to keep a job, aye?
Client: Mm.
Therapist: And harder to—
Client: Like it's hard to get a job 'cause you have to say that you've done prison time and stuff, so it's pretty hard.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And we've talked about that idea of you getting a job and something to do with cars 'cause that's where your passion is.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: Yeah? So, what have you been thinking, um, since we last met, about what you might do about getting that kind of job?
Client: Uh, I don't know if-if I would go into polytech, done courses there or something.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: Yeah. Like, if they've got jobs now.
Therapist: Okay, so you know some people?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: You've gone down that road of kind of going back to school in some ways and getting a tryout or-
Client: Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: -getting a qualification?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah? So, what-what would interest you about going down that same, sort of, path?
Client: Just learn more about cars and just, kind of, hands-on job.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. Yeah, so what in particular? Like, if you could have whatever you wanted, in terms of that sort of work, what would you do?
Client: [sighs] Mechanic, or panel [unintelligible 00:18:02], or just-- I wouldn't care, I just-- as long as it's cars.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. So, as long as it has to do with cars, you'd be sweet with that?
Client: Yes, pretty much.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. So-so what sort of things do you think you need to do to go down that path to get that qualification?
Client: Just I have to get that training, I guess, and then probably get a job.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. So, what sort of training did you-- did these people, that you've been talking about, what did they do?
Client: Like, sort of, um, just at the polytech. I don't know what exactly it was, but—
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: It took them like-- And, it took them like a year or something, and then they went into apprenticeship.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah. So, how confident are you that you could do something similar to these-these friends that you've got?
Client: Yeah. I could do it pretty easy. It's just, like, I probably know all this stuff already.
Therapist: Okay. So, it would be pretty easy. So, if it's pretty easy, what do you need to do next, Billy?
Client: Like, well, I went out and picked some forms and stuff, but it's real confusing, like, having to apply, so I-I just couldn't-- I don't know. I couldn't do it.
Therapist: Okay. So, you actually went to the polytech—
Client: Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: -and picked up some forms?
Client: Yeah, yeah. Passed around and everything.
Therapist: Wow.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: That's fantastic, Billy.
Client: Yeah, but I just-- Like, they wouldn't help me out, so-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -I got some forms and-
Therapist: Tell me- tell me what happened when you say they-- like it didn't help you? What-what-what happened?
Client: I asked- I asked them what I had to do, and they said I had to fill out some forms, but-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -well, the forms, it's too confusing.
Therapist: Okay. So, they gave you a horde of forms for a particular course?
Client: Yeah, yeah. Well, I got one- I got one for panel [unintelligible 00:19:33], and one for, uh, uh, like, panel and paint-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -so, learning how to paint cars and stuff.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. So, you got the forms, took them- took them home?
Client: Yeah. I was gonna fill them out there, but then I didn't get them, so I took them home, but I was gonna get Donna to help me, but I just didn't get around to it.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. You said the forms were confusing?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah? What-what's the confusing bit?
Client: I didn't understand, like, what you're supposed to write down. Like, yeah. I'm not good at this, maybe too confusing.
Therapist: Yeah. So, when you've had to write things or fill out forms before, how-how's that been for you?
Client: I don't really deal with it. I s-- I don't really like writing.
Therapist: You don't like writing?
Client: No.
Therapist: Yeah. So, wondering what that's about, about not actually liking writing.
Client: No, I'm just real messy, so people can't read it.
Therapist: People can't read-- People can't read your handwriting?
Client: [chuckles] Yeah, no. It's what they say, yeah.
Therapist: Oh, you must be a doctor.
Client: Yeah, I am. [chuckles]
Therapist: Yeah? [chuckles] Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. So, you need some help to fill out the forms?
Client: Yeah. Like, a computer or something. If you could write on a computer, I could do that.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: But, we don't have a computer.
Therapist: Okay. All right, so what-what do you need to do, Billy, to actually get to that point where you can fill out a form and post it off?
Client: Just ask to get someone else to do it I guess. I guess I could ask Donna, but it's been embarrassing.
Therapist: Okay, so you feel like it would be embarrassing to ask Donna to give you some help-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -because you feel that she might find out something about you that you're not quite sure you want her to find out?
Client: Well, I don't know if it's that serious, it's just-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -I'm sure most people can fill them out. I don't know, I just don't get it.
Therapist: Hmm. So, who else could you ask to help you?
Client: No one. I guess you. You could do it. Would you do it?
Therapist: Well, have you got the forms with you?
Client: No.
Therapist: Okay. I'm wondering about-- because it sounds like this whole idea about filling out the forms, is getting in the way of this bigger dream that you've got which is around getting a qualification around something to do with cars-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -and getting on this road where you're staying out of trouble because you've got this, um, interest-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -which you can do. So, it seems a real shame that the forms are gonna get in the way, so we need to find a way around the forms.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: Yeah? So, what do you think, between now and next week, you can do around the forms?
Client: I guess, I'd go pick them up and I don't know, I guess I could ask Donna, but she'd probably help me, I don't really want to.
Therapist: She'd probably help you, but you don't really want to. It sounds like you're a bit embarrassed.
Client: Well, I don't know. Plus, well, I don't know if I could bother getting up at nine o'clock every morning and having to go to Polytec. I've got used to sleeping in.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: At night.
Therapist: So, the whole thing about going back to poly-- going back to school-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -going back to polytech is-- would-would require a really big change in the way which you're currently living, and you're not quite sure if you can do that.
Client: Yeah. Uh, it would be cool if it's anything like school. Like, I didn't really enjoy school. [unintelligible 00:22:56] so writing and stuff, and I wouldn't wanna do that. If it's all hands-on though, it would be all good.
Therapist: Yeah. So, there's something here about your level of-- about how confident you are around writing or how unconfident you are, that sounds like it's getting in the way.
Client: Yeah. No, it does get in the way. I just don't wanna do it.
Therapist: Mm. Okay.
Client: It's a waste of time.
Therapist: All right. So, it sounds like we might need to have some more conversation around that.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So, what's really getting in the way?
Client: For what?
Therapist: Well, this writing business. What's really getting in the way?
Client: Of what? Well, I don't get it.
Therapist: Well, I'm wondering, like-- it sounds like it's a thing that you're putting up as saying you can't do-
Client: Yeah. I can't.
Therapist: -so I'm wondering where you are around your writing and you're reading?
Client: Oh, it's pretty [unintelligible 00:23:47], but, like, still-- I don't know, I'm not retarded, or anything. I can write and read.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah. Well, I have to say, I think it's really obvious that you're not retarded.
Client: Like--
Therapist: [chuckles]
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah, we are having a really good conversation here.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So, reading and writing is not a strong point for you.
Client: No, not really. Yeah, I don't really enjoy it.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So, how much reading and writing is involved in the course that you're gonna go on?

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: Thank you for coming in to see me today, Nina. I'm looking forward to getting to know you a little bit and hearing a little bit about you and what brought you in here today.
Client: Um, my doctor referred me. He said I had to come because I've- I've been a little irresponsible with this pregnancy. Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. He's thinking you were a little irresponsible.
Client: Yeah. Um, he said that I was drinking too much with it. Um, I-I haven't been a lot, but he said it was still maybe, um, would screw things up.
Therapist: And you're feeling kind of concerned about that.
Client: Yeah. Yeah. Like I don't- I don't want to screw anything up with this baby, but, um, yeah, I'm just- I'm scared I already did.
Therapist: Okay. So, you're concerned about the consequences, and you really care about your baby, and you want to give your baby the best start you can.
Client: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Therapist: And you're wondering a little bit about this time that we're going to spend together.
Client: Yeah. He didn't really tell me what to expect. He just said, ""Go- go see her as well.""
Therapist: So here you are today and, um, you're sharing that you have been drinking alcohol throughout your pregnancy.
Client: Yeah. Um, I didn't find out I was pregnant until probably two-ish months in-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -and I had already been drinking then. Um, I've been really trying not to, but, you know, weekends come around, and, um, all my friends are kind of partying and stuff, and it's been hard to, like, break that habit.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. So, there's this external pressure coming from the people you care about to sort of stay in the scene.
Client: A little bit. I think if I- if I talk to them, it would be fine, but it's-it's weird, right? Like I'm the only one of my friends that's, like, taking this step and having a kid, and they don't really know how to handle that.
Therapist: Kind of feels like You're between two worlds. In one world, you're preparing to be a mother and bring a baby into this world, and this other world is the world that you've been in for a while where you're kind of having a good time and-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -drinking and your friends are-
Client: Yeah, like, I'm- I'm still, like, I'm only in my 20s, and-and for everyone else, it's like, ""Okay, it's party time,"" and now I kind of have to, like, break out of that.
Therapist: Okay. So, this party-time world's- are you feeling like this is something you want to move out of and move into that mom world? Or does it feel like I want to hang out there still too?
Client: There's, yeah, there's part of me that still wants to live that out because I'm not going to have another chance, like once this kid comes, it's-it's going to be over. I know I'm gonna- I know I'm going to have to change.
Therapist: So, for you, you're feeling like once the baby comes and actually in your arms, then things are going to change, but right now, while you're pregnant, you're thinking, ""I can kind of hang out in both worlds a little bit,"" but part of you may be thinking maybe that's not the case. It's time to go to the mom world maybe.
Client: Yeah. Probably. And I'm also feeling like it's too late. I already screwed it up.
Therapist: Okay. So, you've got a lot of concerns about what's happened to- up until this point, as far as your drinking. What do you know about, um, drinking alcohol throughout pregnancy?
Client: Well, I know, like, they say not to, but I thought because my friends didn't really care, I thought, ""Okay. Like maybe-maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe it's just what they tell you."" Just like drinking, in general, is bad.
Therapist: So, you were thinking because your-your friends weren't pressuring you to stop drinking, that-that it must be okay.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And then there's this other part of you that's- was thinking maybe it's not okay.
Client: Yeah, like, I should probably have trusted my gut.
Therapist: So, your gut is telling you what? Tell me about that.
Client: It's telling me that what I'm doing is wrong and it's probably hurting my kid and that- that I'm gonna really regret that once I actually get my kid.
Therapist: And you really wanna do what's best for your babe. And kind of wondering, um, how to move forward from here, is that where you wanna, you know, kind of focus in on, or what are your thoughts about giving up drinking altogether?
Client: Um, I'm definitely it's not-- I think I could probably do it. It's just- it-it comes hard when you're, like, in that moment. You're around your friends and they're drinking and you don't wanna be- you don't wanna be the mom at that moment. You wanna be yourself. You wanna be who you were before.
Therapist: So, you kind of have this identity, dual identity going on. I wanna be that person, yet, that person-
Client: And so many people, when they have kids, they just vanish from their friends. And I don't wanna be that person. I don't wanna be that person that just has a kid and they're completely-completely different.
Therapist: Mm. So, embraces this life of the picket fence and the, you know, the little house and having the baby in this-
Client: Yeah, suburbs. Yeah.
Therapist: So, you don't wanna be that- that- that woman that's just sort of living in this house with the baby carriage, and at the same time, that world's kind of saying it's behind you.
Client: Yeah, I-I guess. Like, I don't wanna- I don't wanna lose my friends because of this. And I don't wanna put pressure on them to change because they're, I mean, they're good people. They're just—
Therapist: You care about them.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: It's just the scene that they're-they're still in because their life maybe hasn't taken that change that your life has made. And so now, you're here and you're not sure. You want the baby, but you're not sure about the suburbs and the picket fence thing. You're not sure—
Client: I don’t want that.
Therapist: You don't want that.
Client: No.
Therapist: You want this baby.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And you wanna be, um, take care of your baby as the baby's growing.
Client: Like, I wanna- I wanna be responsible for this thing.
Therapist: You don't wanna let your baby down.
Client: No.
Therapist: And at the same time, it's hard to let go of the past, but on the other hand, you're thinking, ""I don't have a choice. I've got to look this way."" Is that kind of what it feels like?
Client: I guess so. I feel like I've already made a choice and already made some bad choices with this.
Therapist: Nina, I'm wondering, what's your hope for the future? When you think about where you are today, um, what do you hope for when you look ahead?
Client: Well, I-I kept the kid because I wanted-- It was almost like that push, that sign for me to, like, move forward and become like an adult because it's scary, right? Like I-I still feel like a teenager sometimes. And having that push to be a real person is really-- It's a lot of pressure and I-I want to raise this kid well. I don't wanna- I don't wanna let my kid down. I don't wanna, you know, I don't wanna regret choosing to have this kid because I think it's the right time, but I don't wanna- I don't wanna make mistakes that make me realize maybe I'm not ready for this 'cause sometimes it feels like I'm not ready for this.
Therapist: You put your heart there that the baby is really- it was almost kind of like a sign for you that was saying, ""This baby is giving you a kind of a new chance at life, or giving you a plan B,"" and you guys both get to decide what plan B is gonna look like.
Client: Yeah, I just guess it's easier said than done though. Like, it's, like, great, I can make all these changes and I can be a completely new person, but it's, like, at the end of the day, I'm still just who I am.
Therapist: While this baby's growing in you and you think of all the opportunities that could come out of this, there's a part of you that says, ""I'm still that same girl that was drinking and partying,"" and-and maybe not living the life you wanted to live.
Client: Yeah. And I'm just- you know, you can't just one day flick a switch and become a new person.
Therapist: While this baby feels like this is your second chance, you're wondering, ""Do I deserve that second chance?"" And then this other part of you that says, ""Why not? It's here and I wanna go for it.""
Client: Yeah, I guess that voice is just a little more stifled by the other one.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. You got a lot of people around you that are kind of pulling it down, and it's kind of taking you back to the old life. And the baby is a constant reminder that there’s this new life ahead.
Client: Yeah, it's gonna be very different when it actually comes.
Therapist: When you think about, you know, embracing this new life, and taking that different path, turning away from path A and moving into path B, how confident are you that you can take path B and be successful in raising this baby, and letting go with the drinking and the life that you were in-in path A?
Client: I think I'm gonna have to be successful. I don't really- I don't have any other choice. Like I have to- I have to take that path.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. Tell me more about that, what makes you say, ""I have to take that path""? What makes you feel like you need that?
Client: Because I need to for my kid. It's- it's gonna be all screwed up if I don't.
Therapist: This part of you that says, ""I don't have an option to-to-to make this life better,"" it's wondering, ""Do I have the confidence to be able to make that life a reality?"" What do you think you need to increase your confidence that you can do this?
Client: I don't know, like, maybe- maybe actually talking to my friends and saying like- or maybe them actually being able to see this kid and go, ""Of course, of course, your- your choice makes sense. You--"" Maybe it would, you know, give them a wake-up call too if They actually, like, see it.
Therapist: So you're thinking that, um, once your friends see you with the baby in your arms that they too will see that there's a different path for them too?
Client: Or at least they'll feel less pressure to be who they want me to be.
Therapist: Mm, kind of feel like you're pulled between two worlds there.
Client: A little bit.
Therapist: It's not easy to be in that world and also having that constant reminder that the baby is coming and this baby is saying, ""I want this better life,"" and you want to give the baby a better life too. Who can support you, do you think when-when you look around who's in your circle right now, who do you think can support you in moving towards path B?
Client: Definitely my parents, um, and I probably need to, uh, go and meet some other-other people who are maybe, you know, having kids too so that I can see, like how it's done 'cause like, I only have a younger brother who's like not-not even close to that. So I don't really have anyone in my life that I know that's had kids recently. So I-I would like to meet other, you know, young moms out there who, you know, are kind of struggling with the same stuff I am.
Therapist: And your parents are a support for you and support you from giving up the drinking, the alcohol use, that's something that they would support-
Client: I don't think they realize, uh, that I'm doing it or how much I'm doing it.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And I know that if they found out, they would be really pissed.
Therapist: That would be a concern for them as well as for you now.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah. Is that something that, um, maybe you and I could meet again about-and talk about having those conversations with-with the family, maybe having conversations about, you know, the folks, your-your friends that are currently in the lifestyle that you were involved with, um, and then sort of what it would look like to go down path B, is that something that you would be open to meeting with me about again?
Client: I think so, yeah, like the telling my parents and [unintelligible 00:13:45] this to my parents is probably the scariest thing.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: And having to talk to those friends, like right now I don't want to do that. It's- it puts them in a weird place.
Therapist: Kind of feels like you're climbing Mt. Everest.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And you don't have equipment.
Client: It feels like I have to lec- I don't wanna have to lecture them and I don't want it to be like a lecture.
Therapist: You're concerned that they're gonna kind of treat you like a child.
Client: My parents or my friends?
Therapist: Oh, oh, you're talking about your friends.
Client: Yeah, lecture my-- Yeah.
Therapist: You're wondering if they're gonna kind of be like children and you're gonna be like the parent saying-
Client: Yeah, and I don't wanna be like that.
Therapist: You just wanna be like peers talking.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And you want them to support you.
Client: I wanna stay friends with them. I don't want- I don't want them to just-
Therapist: You don't wanna lose your support group, yeah. You just wanna them to support you in being healthy, while helping them, raising the babe, and so we're just taking path B. You don't wanna lose them, just maybe the lifestyle it sounds like.
Client: Yeah, like if there's a- if there's a balance between maybe not the paths, but the worlds, if there's a balance between that-
Therapist: Mm. You kind of wanna have the best of both worlds.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: I want the friends and the relationship that I get from my friends, and at the same time, I don't want the party scene that goes with that.
Client: Yeah, like I-I know I just can't cut off my friends altogether.
Therapist: Well, Nina, you know yourself best, and you know, you know, you know what your world looks like and what those, you know, like, you know the support that your friends give you and the support that you get from your family, you know that. And I-I really just wanna support you in being able to make those choices and have those conversations, and I wanna do whatever I can to support you with that. Um, and I'm just wondering if maybe we can kind of pick this up, um, in a next visit, but before we go there, I'm just wondering, is there some steps that you would be willing to kind of take or consider, uh, with-with regards to your drinking?
Client: Um yeah, like I'm so close anyways, that I know I need to now. Um, and I just also, like, have I completely screwed this up, like, is it already too late?
Therapist: You're concerned about the health of your baby. I just would love to share with you, Nina, that every day without alcohol is a good day for your baby, and you know, starting today to have zero alcohol is a great start, and I'm wondering if that's the sort of something you'd be open to as no more alcohol at this point.

Therapist: Yeah.

Client: I've smoked for 40 years, since I was 14-

Client: Mm.
Therapist: Yeah. And you have some ideas about that and some experiences about that. So today I wanna- be good for us to talk about that and, um, I'm really interested to know what you've been thinking about in terms of what you may wanna change in your life 'cause we're gonna be working together for a while here.
Client: Right. Neat. What, um, what have I changed, what am I—
Therapist: What you've been thinking about, um, over the last little while about getting your life back on track. 'Cause I noticed you've—
Client: I've been thinking about how easy it would be to deal P again.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I've been thinking about, um, how I could actually set myself up the right way doing it the wrong way.
Therapist: Sure. So what I'm picking up is-is that-that-that's a life that you know a lot about.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: And you can make lots of money and set yourself up well. What's the other side, because I guess when I talk to guys like yourself who have done time, often they're thinking about actually, mm, maybe life can be with different. So I'm wondering where-where you're at with the kind of thinking about—
Client: Well, at the end of, you know, that last week inside, I was- I had that kind of, okay, what's next buzz? And, you know, it just doesn't work out here.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: I don't have a, uh, uh, I don't know what that is.
Therapist: Sure. So life on the outside is pretty different than the kind of-
Client: Yes.
Therapist: -the expectation of life on the inside something?
Client: Yeah, it's worse.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So tell me how you've been managing. 'Cause I don't know if you'd been back dealing? How have you been managing to-to-to—
Client: I haven't yet, I mean-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -the, uh, the offer's there.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Um, I don't know why I haven't said that I will yet but I mean-
Therapist: Uh, tell me-
Client: -it's there.
Therapist: It's there and-and-and you've a lot of contacts?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: You've been in the system, so lots of context. So this isn't a new challenge for you.

Client: How long have I been out?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Three weeks, one day.
Therapist: Three weeks, isn't it?
Client: Three weeks, one day.
Therapist: So what's been there? What's it about that you haven't done in three weeks one day?
Client: I don't know.
Therapist: 22 days you've actually made a decision not to-to pick up your old life and continue on.
Client: Um, I'd- I- you know, I kind of told myself not to, you know, just before I left. And then I'm just kind of with it and I don't quite know why. [clears throat] I dunno, if, uh, there's no real reason why I haven't yet. It's just that I don't- I just don't think it'll work the way I always dream it will you know, I see myself up like, whatever, if I do that again, the next leg is a long one. A real long one.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And I-I can't go back there. There's no way I'm going back there.
Therapist: Right. So the one hand you've-you-you could sit yourself up and-and take the risk, but on the other hand, you know, that actually it might not last?
Client: No, never lasts.
Therapist: Never lasts. Mm. You seem like a bit of a crossroads to me.
Client: Yep. I've been in crossroads for 12 years.
Therapist: Mm. But there've been times when those crossroads would be more sort of focused than other times.
Client: Yeah. And- [crosstalk]
Therapist: Yeah. And it sounds like maybe like-
Client: -sort of opposite, yeah.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: You know, we're in the middle, you know, and it's actually at the moment, I guess.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But I don't know. You know, that's quite clear that no fucking idea.
Therapist: Okay. Okay. So—
Client: Do you have an idea?
Therapist: No. Well, I've-I've got lots of ideas, but I'm really interested to hearing your ideas kind of first though because you know, and there might be some things that we can work on.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: But I guess what I'm really interested in is-is you've made a commitment 22 days, drug-free. Haven't gone back into that lifestyle. What-what's keeping you, 'cause you're at the crossroads, you kind of just pause there at the moment. I'm not sure about this other bit over here. What keeping you in that place?
Client: Fiona?
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Tell me about Fiona?
Client: She's told me that it's over if I do it. You know, I mean, she-- What tell you about, Fiona I mean she's been with me. She's the one who stayed through all the shit. And I owe her-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -something.
Therapist: Okay. So you've been with Fiona for how long?
Client: 12 years.
Therapist: 12 years. Okay. So she's stood by you then for the time, [crosstalk] but this time she said, it happens again I'm out of here?
Client: Yeah. She's actually got the black and white line down now.
Therapist: Okay. And it sounds like you're listening to that black and white line.
Client: It's pretty she- you know, she could be pretty full-on.
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: Yeah, so it's hard to ignore that line.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean. And it comes with a whole lot of different rules, and you know, she's never been quite like she is now.
Therapist: Okay. So something's changed in your relationship between you, yeah?
Client: Yeah. I think she has. I don't think I have.
Therapist: Okay. So what's Fiona want you from you?
Client: She just wants me. I mean, she just wants someone to be there. Me. She-she remembers me and she wants- she wants him.
Therapist: She wants him. So which him does she want, Daryl?
Client: The one that, you know—
Therapist: Does she want the- did she want the-the him that she fell in love with and saw great things in?
Client: Yeah, that's the one.
Therapist: Or does she want the-the-the-the him that's- that keeps on getting into trouble?
Client: No, no. No one would want him. I don't want him. He's a fuckwit, right? She wants the one that she fell in love with.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So what's it gonna take to reclaim this Daryl that she fell in love with?
Client: If I had the answer to that, I wouldn't need to be sitting here.
Therapist: Sure, yeah.
Client: And I mean, I honest- I don't know, man. I don't know. I-I wish I knew somewhere I could start that, you know, could give it to her, but I-I can't. I-I don't know.
Therapist: All right. Well, let's-let's just play with this idea a little bit, Daryl. So what did Fiona fall in love with? What were the qualities of Daryl that she said, ""This is him""?
Client: I was pretty romantic. I mean, I was pretty quite smooth, and, um, you know, I was on top of my game, like, she- and she loved it. And we used to laugh in the [unintelligible 00:06:45], you know? And just- it was always really sweet, and people used to say, ""Oh, man, you two. You two have just got it,"" you know? And we lost it, so whatever that was, that's what she wants. We were young. How do you become young? Uh, you know, I'm old, and we'll keep growing old, but you know?
Therapist: I know.
Client: Like if I'm not careful, I will be.
Therapist: Sure. Everyone will age, but that will happen on time.
Client: Yeah, certainly.
Therapist: Um, but that's okay. So-so it's she fell in love with this, the sense of fun, the sense of Daryl, and things have changed, but she's still with you?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah. And you're still with her?
Client: Yeah, yep.
Therapist: Yeah. So catch me up with the conversations you've had with Fiona about this crossroads you're at. You know, these 22 days, you haven't gone back, you've coming out and you're not back? You could pick up this dealing quite easily and probably some workout here tomorrow and get back into it.
Client: You know what? She hasn't even talked about the dealing, like, she won't even broach that subject. That's how black and white she is. She's- she'll be- she offers suggestions, you know? What I could do, and- or I kind of go with that, but none of them are-- You know, it's lovely that she's really finding things, but they're not the things. I mean, it-- I started kind of placating her and making it okay to keep giving me suggestions, but like, I need to come up with something because it's like awesome love, but you know, not in love, and she's getting sick of it already.
Therapist: Okay. All right. So-so back together, things are starting to get tense at home, and your relationship a little bit?

Client: Yeah, okay.
Therapist: -so, you're gonna, um, play with me a little bit and, um-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -and you're gonna—
Client: Well, you were asking me why I don't like to take my medicine.
Therapist: Right. So, you're-you're a, um-um, a patient who's been diagnosed with some s- maybe schizophrenia, bipolar.
Client: I like to call it mild schizophrenia.
Therapist: Okay, mild schizophrenia is fine. Good. Okay, so-
Client: And-and-and, uh—
Therapist: -just a touch.
Client: Yeah, just a little schizophrenia. I'm-I'm-- But, I'm okay with it, and so am I.
Therapist: Okay. [laughs] And-and-and, uh, if you wanted to maybe even, you know, a little drinking and weed in there 'cause it's also very kind. [crosstalk]
Client: Oh, that makes me f-- Yeah, that makes me feel-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -relaxed.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I need that.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -I gotta be relaxed, you know-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -if-if you had, you know- if you had to ride around in the back of a garbage truck all day like I do-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -uh, it's, uh- it's stressful, you know. [clears throat] But, the doctor- you know, the other doctor put me on this medicine and-and I gotta take it every day. And, I-I don't like it. Uh, I'll just be honest with you, I don't like it.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: It doesn't-- I don't like the way it makes you feel, um, I don't like the way it makes me act, and it's taken my sex drive, and just thrown it at the back of the garbage truck.
Therapist: Well, that is a bummer. I mean—
Client: It is.
Therapist: So you said the-the first one you said, you don't like the way it makes you feel?
Client: Right.
Therapist: So, tell me a little bit about what you don't like about- what you've noticed about it?
Client: Well, i-it's kinda like I'm in kind of a dreamy world. I-it kind of, I don't know, i-it just seems like I'm kinda like living in the middle of a cotton ball or something like that, where just things are kinda soft and, I don't know, I-- It just, the-the spice of life doesn't seem to be there. It seems like everything's bland, and nothing really-- Food doesn't taste the same, and things don't smell right, and—
Therapist: Very dull.
Client: Very dull.
Therapist: Very dull.
Client: Very dull.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: That's a good way to sum it up. And it's-- Well, you understand it, uh, it's just- it's not good.
Therapist: Mm. So, and then you said, you don't like how it makes you act, um, if you can tell me a little bit about that.

Therapist: Well, you know, what, I-- There are a lot of people that wouldn't disagree with you on that exactly.

Answer: none

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: Thank you for coming in to see me today, Nina. I'm looking forward to getting to know you a little bit and hearing a little bit about you and what brought you in here today.
Client: Um, my doctor referred me. He said I had to come because I've- I've been a little irresponsible with this pregnancy. Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. He's thinking you were a little irresponsible.
Client: Yeah. Um, he said that I was drinking too much with it. Um, I-I haven't been a lot, but he said it was still maybe, um, would screw things up.
Therapist: And you're feeling kind of concerned about that.
Client: Yeah. Yeah. Like I don't- I don't want to screw anything up with this baby, but, um, yeah, I'm just- I'm scared I already did.
Therapist: Okay. So, you're concerned about the consequences, and you really care about your baby, and you want to give your baby the best start you can.
Client: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Therapist: And you're wondering a little bit about this time that we're going to spend together.
Client: Yeah. He didn't really tell me what to expect. He just said, ""Go- go see her as well.""
Therapist: So here you are today and, um, you're sharing that you have been drinking alcohol throughout your pregnancy.
Client: Yeah. Um, I didn't find out I was pregnant until probably two-ish months in-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -and I had already been drinking then. Um, I've been really trying not to, but, you know, weekends come around, and, um, all my friends are kind of partying and stuff, and it's been hard to, like, break that habit.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. So, there's this external pressure coming from the people you care about to sort of stay in the scene.
Client: A little bit. I think if I- if I talk to them, it would be fine, but it's-it's weird, right? Like I'm the only one of my friends that's, like, taking this step and having a kid, and they don't really know how to handle that.
Therapist: Kind of feels like You're between two worlds. In one world, you're preparing to be a mother and bring a baby into this world, and this other world is the world that you've been in for a while where you're kind of having a good time and-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -drinking and your friends are-
Client: Yeah, like, I'm- I'm still, like, I'm only in my 20s, and-and for everyone else, it's like, ""Okay, it's party time,"" and now I kind of have to, like, break out of that.
Therapist: Okay. So, this party-time world's- are you feeling like this is something you want to move out of and move into that mom world? Or does it feel like I want to hang out there still too?
Client: There's, yeah, there's part of me that still wants to live that out because I'm not going to have another chance, like once this kid comes, it's-it's going to be over. I know I'm gonna- I know I'm going to have to change.
Therapist: So, for you, you're feeling like once the baby comes and actually in your arms, then things are going to change, but right now, while you're pregnant, you're thinking, ""I can kind of hang out in both worlds a little bit,"" but part of you may be thinking maybe that's not the case. It's time to go to the mom world maybe.
Client: Yeah. Probably. And I'm also feeling like it's too late. I already screwed it up.
Therapist: Okay. So, you've got a lot of concerns about what's happened to- up until this point, as far as your drinking. What do you know about, um, drinking alcohol throughout pregnancy?
Client: Well, I know, like, they say not to, but I thought because my friends didn't really care, I thought, ""Okay. Like maybe-maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe it's just what they tell you."" Just like drinking, in general, is bad.
Therapist: So, you were thinking because your-your friends weren't pressuring you to stop drinking, that-that it must be okay.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And then there's this other part of you that's- was thinking maybe it's not okay.
Client: Yeah, like, I should probably have trusted my gut.
Therapist: So, your gut is telling you what? Tell me about that.
Client: It's telling me that what I'm doing is wrong and it's probably hurting my kid and that- that I'm gonna really regret that once I actually get my kid.
Therapist: And you really wanna do what's best for your babe. And kind of wondering, um, how to move forward from here, is that where you wanna, you know, kind of focus in on, or what are your thoughts about giving up drinking altogether?
Client: Um, I'm definitely it's not-- I think I could probably do it. It's just- it-it comes hard when you're, like, in that moment. You're around your friends and they're drinking and you don't wanna be- you don't wanna be the mom at that moment. You wanna be yourself. You wanna be who you were before.
Therapist: So, you kind of have this identity, dual identity going on. I wanna be that person, yet, that person-
Client: And so many people, when they have kids, they just vanish from their friends. And I don't wanna be that person. I don't wanna be that person that just has a kid and they're completely-completely different.
Therapist: Mm. So, embraces this life of the picket fence and the, you know, the little house and having the baby in this-
Client: Yeah, suburbs. Yeah.
Therapist: So, you don't wanna be that- that- that woman that's just sort of living in this house with the baby carriage, and at the same time, that world's kind of saying it's behind you.
Client: Yeah, I-I guess. Like, I don't wanna- I don't wanna lose my friends because of this. And I don't wanna put pressure on them to change because they're, I mean, they're good people. They're just—
Therapist: You care about them.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: It's just the scene that they're-they're still in because their life maybe hasn't taken that change that your life has made. And so now, you're here and you're not sure. You want the baby, but you're not sure about the suburbs and the picket fence thing. You're not sure—
Client: I don’t want that.
Therapist: You don't want that.
Client: No.
Therapist: You want this baby.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And you wanna be, um, take care of your baby as the baby's growing.

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: Hi, Mrs. Smith. It's really nice to see you again. I see you're back to follow up on the stroke you had. How are things going for you at the rehab facility?
Client: [signs] Kind of slow.
Therapist: Kind of slow?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: What kind of things have you been in your rehab?
Client: Oh, they have me doing all kinds of things in different machines and stuff. Yeah, it hurts.
Therapist: It hurts? Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Where are you having pain?
Client: Well, just about every joint like especially my knees. They're really-- They have me doing some leg things that-that-that is it really necessary?
Therapist: Well, you know, I-I understand that pain is hard to work through but a lot of time when you're having rehab after a stroke, that pain is telling you that your muscles and joints are starting to work again. So you can kind of think of it as a positive way to, you know, know that your-your body's getting back to normal.
Client: Okay.
Therapist: But what are your goals for the long term?
Client: I wanna go home.
Therapist: Oh, of course, of course. And what are the things that you'd like to be able to do once you get home?
Client: Everything. I wanna- I wanna, play with my dog. I miss my dog. I wanna cook for myself. I'm a very independent person and I wanna do things for myself.
Therapist: Yeah, yeah. And so that's a very important goal to be able to get back home, to be able to get back to your independence. Have you thought about what it might take to get there?
Client: Um, I guess the rehab.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. Yeah, you're absolutely right. And it's also going to be very important that once you're home, you're able to continue on a regular activity program. Have you thought about what that might look like?
Client: Not really.
Therapist: Not really, okay. Well, have you ever heard of something called Tai Chi? Is that a familiar term to you?
Client: Oh, yeah.
Therapist: You've heard of it?
Client: Uh, I have.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: I have a friend who, uh, does it and she just raves about it. She loves it.
Therapist: Well, you know, Tai Chi is one of the best ways to get your balance back after you've had something like a stroke. And it's also really good for preventing falls. And if you wanna be home and you wanna be doing the things you wanna do and going for walks with your dog, it's very important to make sure that you don't fall 'cause that would cause more problems down the road.

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: . So, um, tell me about the exercise.
Client: Well, um, since we spoke last, I've been to the gym a couple of times.
Therapist: You have?
Client: I have.
Therapist: That's fantastic.
Client: Yeah, and actually, my pants feel a little better too. I'm very pleased with it.
Therapist: So, what else have you noticed other than your-your pants are fitting better?
Client: Um, I do feel better.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: My back—
Therapist: Your-- my what?
Client: Well, my back doesn't hurt nearly so much.
Therapist: Wow.
Client: And, um, but it seems like it's, um-- but it's still hard. I'd like to go more often or I-I guess that I'm-- I just need to be a little more patient with myself because it's, um, I'm not, uh, I'm not-- I wanna be able to like spend more time at the gym but right now, it's um, not, um-- Well, I guess I need to build up to it.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. So and what would you-- What would- What would help you get to building up to it? Spending more time there.
Client: Um, well, I guess just sticking with it and not getting, um, sidetracked.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: Like last week, I-I didn't get there at all until like Thursday during the week,-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -so it was- it was a frustrating week like for the gym that way.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: I was kinda busy with some other things, but, um—
Therapist: Mm-hmm. But you made it-- You made it one day-
Client: I-I got—
Therapist: -instead of zero days.
Client: Yeah, and actually, I made it again on Saturday too. So.
Therapist: That's fantastic.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Even with this, you know, pretty horrendous schedule going on.
Client: Yeah. It's been a little-little hectic, you know. And, uh-- But, I-I don't like it too much because there's all these younger guys that can lift a lot more weight than me or they can stay on the treadmill longer and it-it-it's a little discouraging, you know. 'Cause I don't know if you've noticed, I'm not buff and they are. And it's-it's a little discouraging to think how much work it's gonna take to get, you know, kinda back towards that.
Therapist: So you-you'd like to get buffed?
Client: No, but, um, when-when I'm not at the gym, and I am my normal rational self, I realize that I'm, you know, way, way past the age of where I would really even want to do that, let alone want to spend the time it takes. But then while I'm at the gym, and I see the buff young guys, you know, lifting a lot of weight and all that stuff, then you know, the-- I don't know, the urge to be buff comes up in me.
Therapist: So, but for right now, it sounds like the-- just having the pants fit better-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -sounds really, you know, like it's making you feel good about yourself and—
Client: It is.
Therapist: What other positive things have you noticed about the exercise?
Client: Well, I noticed-- Well, I-I still need to work on my diet a lot. I haven't-- I-I'd like to say that by working out at the gym, I have, uh, I've -I've modified my diet, but I haven't very much. I've gotten a little bit better with that, but I'd like to do a lot more.
Therapist: In what way have you gotten a little bit better?
Client: Um, a little bit less junk food. Um, like at times, when I'm like I feel like, ""Oh, I think I'll just go have a candy bar,"" or some worthless thing like that I'll actually have second thoughts before I do it.
Therapist: So you're at the second thought part. And what do you think would-- might take you, uh, over to actually doing it if you wanted to?
Client: Well, I think, uh, when I really start seeing some results at the gym, it's kinda, uh, I think the way it works in my mind is if I've worked out really hard and I've- and I've-- say I've lost a pound that week-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -you know, and then as I'm looking at that double or triple fudge four-decker of ice cream Sunday thing, you know, that somebody is eating, I would say, ""Wow, that would be about two hours on the treadmill."" Then-then that would be probably-- the-- that would keep me from actually ordering one of those.
Therapist: Oh, okay. The payoff just wouldn't be worth that two hours of treadmill versus that double fudgy browny thingy.

Client: But as I say, I-I feel absolutely fine now.
Therapist: So it kind of came a bit of a surprise, you feeling okay.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: You go for this checkup with the doctor. And he says, ""You've got Type II diabetes.""
Client: Mm, I'm very surprised.
Therapist: Mm. Came out of the blue for you?
Client: Yes. I think it did.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: And you said you kind of don't fit that kinda Type II diabetes look. That you kinda have had this idea-
Client: I-
Therapist: -you've been-been overweight with it.
Client: That's what I understand.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: You know, and I'm not overweight.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I-I sort of look after myself to a limited extent in that way. Um, but I'm a busy person, I suppose I burn off the calories. And-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I don't know, really.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: My lifestyle—
Therapist: Hmm. So it doesn't quite fit in your head, Type II diabetes and-
Client: No.
Therapist: -your lifestyle?
Client: No, not at all.
Therapist: Comes as a big surprise. And what was your reaction when he told you that at the time?
Client: Well, I-I thought he must be joking. To be honest. I thought-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -you know, why you are-- Look around you.
Therapist: Mm, mm.
Client: um, I just felt that, um-- I mean, I don't think he was wasting my time because why would he do that?
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: Right?
Therapist: He's got a lot to do.
Client: Um-- Absolutely right.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: He's got a job to do. And obviously, the tests have come through. And I have got these signs of diabetes 2.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Right? Um, I just think that-- Well, I just don't feel like it, Mark.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Um—
Therapist: So how are you feel in your head-
Client: I feel absolutely fine.
Therapist: -and what the tests say kind of like don't join up.
Client: Yeah. Well, physically, I feel absolutely fine.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I'm-I'm-- I didn't see anything wrong with me at all.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: I mean, I get around, I sleep pretty well-
Therapist: Hmm-hmm.
Client: I sort of you know-
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: - I'm-I'm compos mentis. So I don't—
Therapist: Yeah. What's the problem? Mm.
Client: What is the problem?
Therapist: And how did this happen is probably kind of what you're also thinking. Well, how did this--?
Client: Well, uh, yes. I mean-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -I must admit, I haven't done too much research. I've been a bit busy.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Um, but he-he was saying something about, I don't know, family or whatever. I don't know.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And I don't know if it's hereditary.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I think he said something about it being hereditary.
Therapist: So he mentioned, it might be a family thing. And so you-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -maybe got from your parents or something of the sort.
Client: Yeah, it could be-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -because, um, my mother mentioned-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -that, uh, my father had diabetes-
Therapist: Right.
Client: -diabetes 2. And if I think about it, um, his brother-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -uh, I haven't seen him for years.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But he might well have it because he is-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -a pretty cuddly guy. You know-
Therapist: Right.
Client: He's pretty big.
Therapist: So he fits the picture-
Client: Well, yes, the stereotype,-
Therapist: -when you think about what he-he-- Yeah, he's stereotypical.
Client: Yeah, I guess.
Therapist: A little bit bigger, perhaps doesn't look after himself that well, and he fits that foot
Client: Well, yeah. I mean, as far as I know, I hadn't seen him for-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -I don't know how many years.
Therapist: Mm. So you got this knowledge as a witness there's some family history of diabetes in the past?
Client: Apparently so. Yes, apparently so.
Therapist: Doctor mentioned that as being a factor.
Client: Mm, I mean, it is hereditary, is it?
Therapist: That's certainly true. Yes. We know that people who've had parents or have been in the past, there is a hereditary factor or genetic factor in-involved.
Client: A genetic factor. And so, does that mean that if you've got, um, if you've got a history of this within your family-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -if it's a gene-- you are more likely than not to get it?
Therapist: Correct. Yeah.
Client: Also, it's—
Therapist: But it's not inevitable.
Client: Right. Okay.
Therapist: Because its genes or the-the-the-the hereditary factor is not the only factor that causes it or is involved in it happening to you. So there's other factors that come into play.
Client: I'm sure you're going to tell me what they are.
Therapist: Well, you've-you've mentioned some of the things you know, and one of those is hereditary factors. You mentioned that the doctor mentioned that. And what else do you know or have you heard? You say you haven't had a lot of time to do the research. What else? Other things you've.
Client: To be frank, Mark, I honestly don't know. I mean, I honestly don't know what causes it because I've never had any reason. It came upon me from the GP and it took me back.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, the hereditary thing I thought, well, maybe that's the explanation.
Therapist: That makes a bit of sense.
Client: And why go any further, it's there?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Can't help it.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: They live pretty long lives, they did, all right.
Therapist: They managed with it.
Client: Relatives relatively went into their 70s.
Therapist: Okay. I don't know if it'd be helpful for you if you'd like to know a little bit more about some of the factors involved in time Type II diabetes.
Client: Well.
Therapist: If that would help.
Client: If there's something that you think that-- Yes. Yes, of course.
Therapist: Well, I'll perhaps share with you what I know from working with other people and some of the things I've experienced in working with people.
Client: Okay.
Therapist: And see what you make of it. See if it fits a little bit more with where you're at. We know that there is a strong family factor or hereditary factor, so that's one aspect. So also it tends to happen a little bit later in life, rather than something you might get when you're a teenager, this type of diabetes. So-so it's a later onset. It takes a bit of time for it to develop maybe. And the main reason I think, um, the main aspect of it is that it, have you heard about insulin.
Client: I've heard of it yeah.
Therapist: So that's a hormone or a chemical, it allows you to utilize sugar in your body.
Client: Right.
Therapist: All right. And Type II diabetes typically people have a resistance or a resistance to insulin in their cells, in their fat cells or their muscle cells or liver cells. They can't use insulin. And so sugar builds up in your system.
Client: Are you saying that they-they like they can't digest insulin or is that?
Therapist: You need insulin in your cells, individual cells in muscle or in fat or wherever to, um, use up excess sugar or to utilize sugar.
Client: Oh, I see. So-so it's like a-it's like a balance.
Therapist: That's right.
Client: So insulin you-you.
Therapist: Kind of, as your.
Client: You have yourself draws bar.
Therapist: Yap.
Client: Or something, and then what balances that out in the body is the insulin taking off the excess.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Or-or digesting? Should I say the excessive sugars?
Therapist: That's a good way to think.
Client: Is that what happened?
Therapist: Exactly. And what's happening in Type II diabetes is your-your fat cells and liver cells and muscle cells are resistant to insulin. It's almost like they're saying we can't use that.
Client: Why?
Therapist: And if-- Well, there's a number of-- We're not entirely sure, there's a lot of research still going on as to how this happens and how that could be modified. But what we do know is that, um, one of the key things in managing it is to try and modify or modulate, control the amount of sugar that are in your system.
Client: Right. Okay.
Therapist: Yeah. So there's a couple of things that we know that people with Type II diabetes have to look after and have to think about if they want to control the amount of sugar that's in their system, which is the main issue that's causing some of the health problems that people have with Type II diabetes. Too much sugar, and if it's not able to be utilized in the blood cell, in the fat cells, or liver cells, and the muscle cells stays in your bloodstream. And that can cause problems with your circulation. So too high blood sugar and too low a blood sugar can be a problem. So sugar is the main concern in Type II- Type II diabetes.And you mentioned earlier on, a couple of things that the doctor-- You've mentioned some signs that he was kind of a little bit concerned about. Well, what things did you notice over the-over the last month or so?
Client: You mean, personally?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Well, I didn't know. I mean, the thing is you see that-- I mean, I did think about this a little bit and I thought, well, over time, if things happen slowly, you don't really notice.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: As you get older.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I don't-I don't leap over five bar gates like I used to, you know, um, as opposed to, uh, running with the backs now, I tend to spend more time, you know, with my old mates in the bar.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: At the rugby club and-and-and the such like, yeah. And, um, the fish I'm hooking, I'm not after the kings anymore, I go for the snapper now, it's a bit easier, you know.
Therapist: A slightly more sedate lifestyle.
Client: Yeah, absolutely. You just do.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: You just do. Um, so you're less demanding, I guess, on your-on your body, you realize, and you don't really want to do these things anyway. You know, you let the youngsters get home.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Been there, done that. So you don't really notice. So I'm coming back to this diagnosis I had from my GP and him saying, ""You've got diabetes 2,"" well, I should feel like that, shouldn't I?
Therapist: Yeah. It should feel like there's something really wrong with you.
Client: Yeah, I mean.
Therapist: What's-how have you been feeling over the last month? So, you say you're very busy you're doing a lot of work.
Client: Yeah, I mean I'm a busy person. All right? I uh, my work uh, I work in insurance, so I'm always hopping from one place to another place.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, I haven't noticed.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: I really haven't noticed how, um, okay I get a bit--I suppose I get a bit out of breath sometimes.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: If I rush too much that-that's true. Um, I suppose, um, I don't go upstairs two at a time anymore, I use one at a time.
Therapist: So a little bit sort of energy is not quite there sometimes? The vitality.
Client: Oh, certainly the energy I have is-is not what I-what I had. I mean I do need to, you know, I'm busy but I do need to sit down, um, uh, I do need to sit down and relax with a cup of coffee, you know, and, uh, things.
Therapist: Yeah, Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, more than I would normally.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But that would be, that would be about it.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, is it getting worse? I don't know. I-I-I suppose. What worse? Is it-is it increasing? Well, to say, I don't really notice it.
Therapist: You haven't noticed it. So it's a progressive, you know, you've just seen this, as-as you got older, things have slowed down. You know those activities you used to do, but that's kind of like what happens.
Client: Yeah, yeah. Um, at least, that's what I think. I mean I don't know if you're telling me that I should be more active or my GP is saying I should be more active.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, as I say, uh, you know I-I don't do any regular form of exercise, I have to say, not anymore.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: But maybe I-maybe I don't know.
Therapist: Hmm, a bit of a mystery there.
Client: I mean I've got uh, well I-I mean I've got a great lifestyle. I mean if it's very-it-it's very good. I mean I've got all my mates in down at the rugby club. And I've got uh, you know even in the summer when that's a bit damn. I used to coach rugby and I coached cricket when I finished playing. So-so I've got the-the guys in the cricket club, um, you know, for the-for the, uh, for the summer evenings. And, uh, and then, uh, the-then, of course, we've got the fishing, and that's all of us combined. We're a big gang, really.
Therapist: Really? So what I'm hearing is there's actually a lot of aspects in your life which are really good.
Client: Oh, I think my life yeah. My life is great.
Therapist: From your perspective, things are going well?
Client: My life is great, and then you turn around and say, ""Hey you've got-- you-you're ill, you're sick.
Therapist: Yeah. It doesn't fit.
Client: And um, no I'm not. But you see, he said to me that he's gonna put me on some sort of, uh, a daily monitoring of, is it sugar levels?
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: And I'm gonna have to take regular pills.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Well frankly, the only pills I take are sort of paracetamols.
Therapist: Yeah. When you get uh, a headache.
Client: For a bit of the head in the morning, you know.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um.
Therapist: So the idea of having to test-test your blood sugar and take medications is kinda like off--
Client: Come on, you know.
Therapist: And you know that's a bit too-
Client: Well, life is too short.
Therapist: Too much.
Client: You know it's the truth.
Therapist: Yeah. Okay.
Client: I mean you know—
Therapist: And you're here today and that's probably something in you you've thought well I'll follow this through, you know I'll-I'll come along and see what-see what they've got to say. And I'm just wondering for this session, for the time we have today, there's a number of things we could talk about. You mentioned a couple of things about your lifestyle and, um, medication is one thing you've been told by the doctor you might need to do that. And a number of things that we could talk about today. Which-which area would you think would be useful for you to focus on?
Client: Well there is-there is something that you sort of prompted me to think about, and, um, I split up-- My wife and I, we split up several years ago now. And, um, you know we've been married for many many years.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: And um, I think she used to look after me because she used to do the cooking and-and-and stuff like that.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And I have to say that I'm not the best cook in the world.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, and-and being on the run all the time and you know once I get back home, it's, you know, it's time to go down to the rugby club or whatever it might be, uh, we're out with the mates. And, uh, I-I do I suppose my food is not as healthy perhaps as it used to be when she was around. She's moved down to Hamilton to live with her mother, if you've met her mother. Anyway, but, um.
Therapist: So then, since you've been on your own since you've separated, divorced and you've noticed that the things you eat and how you eat has changed.
Client: Yeah, I mean mates and their wives are pretty cool about it sometimes.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Because, you know, they'll invite me for dinner and so on.
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: And, yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess, you know, that's when you, well, or whatever reason, you split up in life.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You start looking at the home life of somebody else, you're thinking, ""Hmm, I use d to have this.""
Therapist: Hmm. Yeah, yeah.
Client: And you think, "" This is nice food, "" isn't it? and you know.
Therapist: Yeah. And your-- part of your wife used to do a lot of that for you?
Client: Oh, she would do all the cooking. Yeah, yeah,
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I never bothered to boil an egg in the water, you know.
Therapist: And so she would kinda look after what you ate and healthy things that you had, spread in front of you and off you go.
Client: Totally. I mean, I was just in charge of the wine, you know.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. And now you have to think about what you might eat and sometimes you don't eat the best.
Client: Well I-- This is what I'm saying. Maybe I'm not thinking about it. Maybe that's the thing.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Maybe I'm just—
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You know, because it-- you know this-- the pizza shop's just on the road.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And then there's-- I mean, okay, I confess that lunchtime, occasionally, it's uh, I'm hungry and McDonald's is very convenient
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -or Kentucky Fried or whatever.
Therapist: Very appealing, isn't it?
Client: You know, it's very easy. and then, um, then you think to yourself, well-- I mean, I do think of myself that maybe I should have a few vegetables around here or whatever. But then you go out into the supermarkets, you know, and you can pick up, uh, your- one of your TV dinners.
Therapist: Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm.
Client: So you bring those in and you open them up and put them in the microwave and there's vegetables there.
Therapist: Yeah they look pretty good on the plate, don't they?
Client: Yeah, it looks- it looks fine, you know, et cetera. I mean, so that will happen occasionally if I've got a night in. But cooking-wise, no, I haven't cooked anything, um, other than boil the water for the kettle for a cup o coffee.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -for ages.
Therapist: They're food choices in what you eat and what's in your diet it's not what-something you actually you've actually been aware of or had to think about in the past.
Client: Yeah. I do miss her breakfast. I have to say, we used to have get a nice breakfast.
Therapist: So one thing that you noticed is diet and the eating patterns and-
Client: Well—
Therapist: -when you eat. That's one aspect. What other aspects do you think you've-- you would be--?
Client: Well, I used to be quite a heavy smoker, right? I mean, I'd smoke a pack in a half a day. And I knew that wasn't doing me any good.
Therapist: Right.
Client: I mean the thing is when you're a-- I mean, I've always smoked. So, but when you're young and you're a sportsman, you know—
Therapist: You kinda juggle those two things and kinda--
Client: Well, the two things they balance out, you know and everybody else is
Therapist: You still run and have a cigarette?
Client: You know, you pass a cigarette down the backline almost, don't you? You know, just before the game gets—
Therapist: Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, part of the culture.
Client: Yeah, part of the of the whole thing. And it's changed a bit now, because in my day when we were playing, of course, it was a very much more of a social game, which was spent-spent in the rugby club.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: That's why you played and it was a big buddy-buddy thing.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: That was rugby and cricket was the same really.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Um, but now—
Therapist: But over the years, you've actually reduced your smoking or you've stopped altogether or at times?
Client: Well I-I, yeah. I was getting a bit sort of-- I was getting a bit, you know, a bit wheezy and I thought, ""I'll cut this out.""
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: But I enjoy smoking. I really do enjoy it. So I cut it down to I suppose it's about 10 a day now.
Therapist: Okay, so you meant to reduce.
Client: Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: You were noticing that it's having an impact on your breathing and health wasn't so good.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: When you related that to your smoking, so you managed to reduce your smoking.
Client: Yeah, yeah. I sort of—
Therapist: So you've made our decision to do that?
Client: it-it-it's-- you know, she will, ""Why don't you give up? You've gone so far, why don't you just stop?"" But I don't want to.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: It's-it's-- I-I enjoy it, um—
Therapist: Yeah, and it's hard to get to stop something you enjoy, isn't it?
Client: Well, yeah. I mean, you know, the thing is that you get to, you know, you've got to-- when you get down to that, you, uh, you have to regulate sort of-
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You know, you have to be quite strong-willed about, I suppose, in a way.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: So you say, ""Okay, well, you don't have a cigarette unless you have a cup of coffee. [laughs]
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know.
Therapist: But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?
Client: Oh, yeah, yeah. I have two sugars. A couple of sugar in coffee. Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: So we cut that down as I say.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: But the problem goes that coffee, we're up to 8 or so, 10 cups of coffee a day now.
Therapist: You're drinking more coffee. So what I've heard you say so far is, if I can just start right back from the beginning and you used to come in and sais, ""I went to the doctor."" You went for-- it sounds like you went for just a checkup.
Client: No, you know, there's a friend of mine, one of the guys down the rugby club, he said- he said, ""I'm going for my annual, you know-
Therapist: MIT.
Client: -warranty of fitness, sort of thing, you know. And I thought, now that's an idea, not been to one of those.
Therapist: Got to check out, why not?
Client: So I'm 55, and you read in the papers, you know, it's that at 55 you will-- you know, heart disease is more prevalent
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: -and all these sorts of things that you get around this middle-age time. So I thought, ""Well, I'll go and have one."" And frankly, when I went along, I was very confident. I thought, you know, the doctor is going to saying, ""Hmm, I wish I was as healthy as you,"" sort of thing.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, but unfortunately, uh, he-he came up with this. And it's the only thing I think he really came up with. I think-
Therapist: So everything else looked pretty good?
Client: My cholesterol is quite good, not too bad.
Therapist: Cholesterol good, your weight is good.
Client: Yeah-yeah. Not too bad.
Therapist: Um, you are smoking, but you've managed to reduce that.
Client: Well, yeah, I've cut it down, yeah. I mean, that's been three years, mind.
Therapist: And anything else, you know, you go ticking down the list. The tire is good, oil good.
Client: Absolutely.
Therapist: So we're looking good.
Client: And then we come to this-
Therapist: And ah, hang on.
Client: -too much sugar in the tank, or something. I don't know.
Therapist: Yeah, there's something wrong with the, uh, with this bit.
Client: So, yeah.
Therapist: And it doesn't quite fit with how you see your own lifestyle.
Client: No.
Therapist: Because you've-- it sounds like what you've been doing, you've made some conscious effort to be aware of some of those things you might think are important.
Client: I mean, yeah. I mean, you know, the thing is, you see, the thing is, and I mean, and probably you've-- I think you've heard this before, but people, they turn around, oh, uh, you know, doom and gloom prophets, you shouldn't drink.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: You shouldn't smoke.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And then I think to myself, ""Well, maybe I shouldn't socialize."" And then after that, ""Well, maybe I shouldn't be alive.""
Therapist: So like a domino effect, and they'll all be just sitting-
Client: You know. I mean, what-what-what's going on here? This is- this is- this is so many people's lives.
Therapist: Mm-hm.
Client: And um, I suppose, you know, if it came down to it, then, and somebody said, ""Well, you can solve this problem by taking a pill once a day, um, you know, it will keep it down, and there will be no problems,"" Then I-I could go with that. But what I don't want to do, um, the doctor was saying, or insinuating, that I'd have to change my lifestyle.
Therapist: A bit broad kind of like you've gotta change everything.
Client: Yeah. It was um, and I-I said, well, no. I'm sorry. [coughs] I'm not going to change my lifestyle. I've got to where I am. I'm reasonably happy. Okay, I wish I wasn't separated. Okay, I wish my kids were-were still around, um, you know. One of them is off now in, um, in-- back in Europe playing rugby in France.
Therapist: Yeah. And your thought was, yeah, right, I hear that, but actually, I don't want to make all these big changes in my life.
Client: No, I don't want to, because I don't feel that I need to.
Therapist: Feel like you need to. Yeah.
Client: I mean, it's you know, why?
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Um, I can't argue with a medical professional, Mark, because I know nothing, you know.
Therapist: The test, is the test, and experience, yeah.
Client: So, I mean, what-what-what-what suggestions would you have? I mean, what-what sort of-
Therapist: I don't know. I think it's up to you where we start, and that's the question I've got in my mind. You've mentioned a couple of things that you've already made some effort, or been conscious of. You've mentioned the diet, you've mentioned your smoking, those are two quite important aspects that we often talk about here in how people work.
Client: Is smoking related to diabetes then?
Therapist: It can have an impact, yes. So smoking, um, affects your blood system, so it hardens the arteries, um, and over time, it can have a significant impact on the healing of wounds. So people with Type II diabetes, often, if they get a cut, or a bruise, or something, it takes a long time to heal. Smoking reduces the amount of oxygen in your system, so that can further, you know, limit the time it takes your body to heal.
Client: Oh.
Therapist: So we know that smoking and Type II diabetes together-
Client: Don't help.
Therapist: -isn't a good combination.
Client: Is it okay if you have one without the other? I'm sorry, it's a silly question. [laughs]
Therapist: Well, the question is, I suppose, that I have for you is, where would you think, for you, would be a good place to start? If you were gonna make any changes, even small changes at the beginning, rather than just thinking, oh, I got to change everything, which it sounds like you're not prepared to, you know, do a whole lifestyle change, and I don't think that's what we're talking about here. Where would you feel most comfortable to start if you were gonna make any changes at all?
Client: Where would I start? Well, I-- What if about if I cut down on sugar in the coffee? If we could have long blacks, no milk, and no sugar.
Therapist: Yeah. Hmm, that might be a start.
Client: I think I could- I think I could probably handle that.
Therapist: Hm. What we also find is that people make these little changes, small changes, and that starts to kind of well, it makes them-
Client: Something of a rollover effect.
Therapist: -rollover, the domino effect starts to happen, and they start looking at other aspects.
Client: Domino effect, yeah.
Therapist: So rather than thinking, ""oh, my God, I have to change all these things. I've gotta stop smoking, I've gotta exercise more, I've gotta, you know, start eating more fruit and vegetables,"" you might start with these small changes, and then-
Client: I mean, how much exercise should I do a week?
Therapist: Um, I-I'm reluctant to give a prescription for that because I think it's really up to you. And I think it depends on how things go, as to how much you need to do.
Client: Right.
Therapist: You mentioned earlier on, the doctors talking about you monitoring your blood sugar.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So on how-- It depends on how-how that goes. Let's say, if you started doing that and you do some more exercise, you start to have longer blacks, rather than short blacks with lots of sugar. And you get down the sugar and you find your blood sugar starts to come down, then we're heading in the right direction.
Client: Okay, so—
Therapist: So it's really, I suppose, up to how things go for you, and you get that feedback. And if that's going in the right direction, you carry on doing and do some more of that.
Client: So, a-are we saying then that-that, really all I need to do, for this moment, is I can forget about everything, but cut out the sugar, uh, in the coffee and the milk-- I don't know, but you might as well, you know, milk without sugar is silly. But, um, if we do that, is that where we start?
Therapist: I think where we start is where you feel comfortable starting.
Client: Well, I mean that's something that's not difficult to do.
Therapist: Apples for breakfast.
Client: You start off at breakfast and get yourself an apple, a bit-a bit of apple and-and so on. Um—
Therapist: So what I'm hearing you're kind of saying is, that there's-- You're now starting to think of some very useful little starting points.
Client: Maybe.
Therapist: Not huge changes, but some little things you could do.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And it's kind of dawning on you there may be some possibilities here for making some changes. Let me ask you this. Um, let's say you put some of these things in place and you start to make some of these small changes.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Um, where do you see that taking you in the next set of three, four, five years? You know, where do you want to be in three to four years' time? What would be your ideal picture?
Client: Well, you know, and this is difficult because I don't feel unhealthy now.
Therapist: No.
Client: So, I suppose it would be fun to-- Maybe I should join a club or two, that's what I'm thinking because I'll be with mates.
Therapist: Yeah? You like the social aspect?
Client: I love the social aspect of it, and, um, there's-there's-- I know there's a bar in this club as well. I-- Don't-don't misunderstand me, I don't drink-
Therapist: No, no, I get that. I get that.
Client: -till-- You know, I'm not an alcoholic or anything like that, I—
Therapist: So part of that whole keeping fit and exercise stuff is actually the social side of it, isn't it?
Client: So yeah, so to get that balance, and maybe that's what I'm actually missing in life, and maybe this is, um-- I mean yes I do get up in the morning sometimes, and I suppose I do feel a bit—
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: You know? Even after a decent night's sleep, you know?
Therapist: Haven't quite that-
Client: And you need-- I'm getting this cup of coffee and maybe I'm—
Therapist: And the coffee helps a little bit because it perks you up?
Client: And that gets me going. Yeah.
Therapist: And the sugar in it helps too.
Client: Yeah, the sugar gives me the boost, I suppose. I-it's fantastic.
Therapist: So what I'm hearing is that your life, your work, your routines are-- Sometimes you're driving or you've got to keep awake, get up in the morning sometimes and you haven't quite got that buzz or the energy. You need a shot, and then throughout the day you might need just more shots to keep that energy up.
Client: Hmm. If I give up sugar in my coffee, give up the milk, black coffees, right?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: if I find some social form of exercise, like squash.
Therapist: And an activity which has got a starting to finish and it's something you do for a slot.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And then there's maybe some social aspects to it as well.
Client: Yeah, and then—
Therapist: You can see some benefits and some enjoyment that.
Client: And then, you know, give this, say, six months, I don't know what period it would be, then go back to the GP and say, ""Test me again.""
Therapist: That sounds like a great plan.
Client: And so maybe that would, uh—
Therapist: Yeah, sounds like a good idea.
Client: Maybe it's an idea. I mean—
Therapist: I think anything you do, it has to be something you've decided. You know, just start where you want to start. You've mentioned some really good ideas about possibly getting a little bit more exercise into your life, doing something like squash or something of that nature. You've mentioned some really good ideas about reducing the amount of sugar you-you-you're-you're intaking during the day, and coffee is a good place to start. Having an apple for breakfast, I think you mentioned that, a bit of fruit.
Client: Yeah, like my wife used to. Yeah.
Therapist: Those are some really good ideas and good starting points. So thinking about it like that, what-- Where are you now? What's your-- What-what-- Where-where is your thinking now?
Client: Well, you see, I mean, I'm thinking, ""Actually it might not be a bad idea this,"" because [chuckles] it would mean I could socialize harder, couldn't I? No, no I'm just joking. Uh, but, um, yeah, I mean, why not? Why not? Why not? It might be fun, it's a new path.
Therapist: What's to lose? What's to gain?
Client: Well, it would appear that there is something to gain, and-- I mean, I-- What do I lose? I don't know until I do it. But I'm thinking that if I do it and I do what I'm enjoying doing, I won't miss what I'm not doing. Does that make sense?
Therapist: It does make sense, yeah.
Client: Um, yeah I don't mind. I-- It's not a—
Therapist: So when you look at it, there's probably more to gain from making these changes than there is to lose.
Client: I'll talk to Billy about, um-- Billy is, um, he's the gym bloke.
Therapist: Right.
Client: I'll have a word with him because I'm due down the club tonight.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Really.
Therapist: So you've got to work these things on your mind. You know, the-- And workout where's the place to start.
Client: Yeah, I think that you say where-where you're at now, where you're going, where—
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -and-and-and this is what I've got to do. I think I'm in a rut. I think that's where I've—
Therapist: You've been stuck?
Client: I'm-I'm just-- I'm-I'm satisfiedly sort of contented, uh, sitting in this- in this rut and, um, that my doctor has actually di-diagnosed me with diabetes 2-
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: -which he says can be managed, and you seem to be insinuating that it can be managed.
Therapist: Indeed, yeah.
Client: Uh, maybe this is a blessing, actually-
Therapist: So rather than--
Client: -because I think to myself, ""Well, if someday, I am diagnosed with diabetes, I'd just carry on and-""
Therapist: Carrying on.
Client: ""-sitting in the corner of the bar, and chat, and talk and probably get fat."" I don't know, and make it worse. And, yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.
Therapist: So it's been a bit of a-a bit of a shock, but now you kinda reflect on it.
Client: Yeah, that's cool.
Therapist: Maybe this is the-
Client: That's really cool.
Therapist: -bit of a shake that I needed, you know, just sort of remind me. I might feel okay. I might-- From my perspective, your perspective, you're thinking, ""Well, what's the problem? Everything's fine.""
Client: Mm.
Therapist: But now you seem to be thinking looking and thinking, ""Maybe things weren't, or aren't, as good as I thought they were.""
Client: Yeah, I mean, I think you're quite right. I think you just—
Therapist: Things could be better?
Client: I don't know, you become sedentary, don't you? No, it seems that-- No, actually, this is quite exciting. It quite [unintelligible 00:31:28]
Therapist: Yeah, I sense that. I sense that in you that you're--
Client: I think to myself, I think, ""Oh,"" I think go—
Therapist: Quite invigorated with the idea of--
Client: Yeah. I mean, this is- this is- this is cool, it's like an old challenge again.
Therapist: Making some of these changes. Yeah.
Client: This is good. And, um—
Therapist: You're up for the challenge?
Client: I think I am. I mean, I never thought about it, but when I think about it now it's, ""What am I doing here?"" Why am I like this? Why am I just happy contented to drift?
Therapist: So think about when you were-- This-this is an interesting question to see what you think. You were- you were a coach. You-- Maybe you'll be a coach again.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: What would you say if you were talking to yourself, if you like, you know, if you were the coach saying, ""Right--""
Client: Oh, so if I was obs- if I was sort of-
Therapist: Yeah, what-what would you be saying?
Client: -observing as it were?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Watching myself, what would I say? I-I-- Well, I would say, you know, are you happy?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: That-- Are you contented with that performance of you and your team?
Therapist: And, I suppose, our own personalized a little bit like that, there's lots of different aspects that need to be tweaked.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Modified and looked at, to get the best out of ourselves, to get the best out of the opportunities we have.
Client: I think you're- I think you're right. I think, um-- And again, you put them together and it's-it's-it's becoming-- It's-it's a sort of a-an individual team job, isn't it really?
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: That, okay, do a bit of this and do a bit of that.
Therapist: Some good things I'm- some things I'm good at and there are some other aspects we think, ""Well--""
Client: Yeah, but I don't have to give up anything really, do I?
Therapist: It's not about giving up your personality or-

Feel free to return none as the therapist utterance might not have any reflection.

Here are a few examples.

Examples:

Example 1
Client: But-but the wheezing is something that I've definitely noticed a little bit.
Therapist: I guess I also wonder whether, regardless of-of if your asthma symptoms are connected to Oscar, that may be part of you feels like it's worth it because he's been-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: -such a big part of your life for so long.
Answer: complex

Example 2
Client: Um, I'm just- yeah I just like to have a few drinks. I mean, you know, obviously, I-I have, uh, this diagnosed condition, and-and I think, you know, if I were able to, you know, maybe take a few hits off of the joint and have a couple of beers, I think that's about the same as taking the medicine.
Therapist: Well, you know, what, I-- There are a lot of people that wouldn't disagree with you on that exactly. You know, so, um, uh, but I know that they-they were never quite sure how they were all interacting all together. Like the, um- the weed kind of tends to make people a little paranoid anyway.
Client: Yeah, I-I-I got to be careful with it. If I take more than a hit or two of it, it-it-it can be a bit of a problem.
Therapist: Yeah. Why, what happens if you take a little too much of it?
Answer: none

Example 3
Client: That's a good way to sum it up. And it's-- Well, you understand it, uh, it's just- it's not good.
Therapist: Mm. So, and then you said, you don't like how it makes you act, um, if you can tell me a little bit about that.
Answer: simple

Example 4
Client: Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know.
Therapist: But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?
Answer: complex

Example 5
Client: I wanna stay friends with them. I don't want- I don't want them to just-
Therapist: You don't wanna lose your support group, yeah. You just wanna them to support you in being healthy, while helping them, raising the babe, and so we're just taking path B. You don't wanna lose them, just maybe the lifestyle it sounds like.
Answer: none

Example 6
Client: Um, I mean, I guess- I guess I need some strategies for figuring out how to ease stress without, I guess, getting high.
Therapist: Okay. And that's a very good reason for being here. Um, can you talk to me about maybe some of your-- the goals that you have?
Answer: none

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: Thank you for coming in today, Katie. I'm looking forward to getting to know you, and maybe just wanna start off with just sharing a little bit about you and what brought you in today?
Client: Uh, yeah, sure. Um, I guess, well, my doctor referred me to see you. Um, I guess he has some concerns about, um, my- my pregnancy and- and my baby. So, um, yeah, well, I'm doing what I'm told.
Therapist: So you're following through on meeting with me today and you mentioned he has some concerns. Can you tell me a little bit about that?
Client: Uh, yeah, he is concerned about my alcohol intake.
Therapist: Okay. And I'm wondering if you have any concerns about that.
Client: Uh, no.
Therapist: No. Okay. So that's- that's not been an issue for you. Uh, it is an issue for him and not for you at this point.
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: Okay. So what about maybe sharing a little bit about your alcohol intake and maybe a little bit about what your- what your life's like a little bit for me today?
Client: Um, okay. Uh, well, I guess I drink like a glass of wine at supper every night, and just to, you know, relax a little with my friends if I go out. So wine has always been a kind of a family tradition with supper. So-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So it was kind of been a part of your culture a little bit, and you know, just find alcohol, maybe takes the edge off a little bit and-
Client: Yeah, and I, you know, I-I have friends who have drank during pregnancy, and-and I see articles on Facebook and-and, you know, things that show that there isn't really a clear link between, you know, abnormalities or, uh, yeah, I just- I just think it's kind of an old wives' tale. So, you know, I'm independent and I'm gonna- I'm gonna do what I want, it's my body.
Therapist: Okay. So you don't feel very comfortable with somebody telling you what you should be consuming, what kind of alcohol, and how much alcohol you should be consuming. And, um, it sounds like you've been getting some mixed messages, your doctor's saying there's no safe amount of alcohol you can drink, and asked you to come and see me. And then also, you've been checking- sounds like you've been checking things out a little bit.
Client: Yeah. You know, I've looked it up to see, you know, kinda what I can say back, you know, to support my argument.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Yeah, which is that, um, I'm going to do what I- do what I wanna do and what I know, right? So it's- yeah. I don't know, but, um, I'm here anyway. So-
Therapist: So you know yourself best and you wanna be sort of the boss of your body and you don't want somebody else telling you what- what's okay and what's not okay. And it seems like you're not maybe too concerned right now about your substance use.
Client: Nope. I never have been.
Therapist: Okay. And I'm wondering if that concern is coming from, ""It's been okay. I've got these messages from friends.""
Client: Yep.
Therapist: ""Um, media has said it's okay to drink during alcohol. And so that concern, um, just sort of, I don't have it and, and maybe the doctor might be wrong.""
Client: Mm-hmm. I think so.
Therapist: You're not sure if he's sort of playing things up a little bit there?
Client: Yeah. I mean, you know-
Therapist: It might be a bit extreme to-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -to quit drinking. Um, I'm just wondering, have you, um, would you be open maybe to just kind of taking a look at what Canada's guidelines say about drinking? Um, is that something you'd be open to?
Client: Like right now?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Uh-
Therapist: What if- uh, can I show you a brochure about that?
Client: Uh, yeah, I guess.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Sure.
Therapist: Well, if we take a look at the low-risk-alcohol drinking guidelines, what it says is for women, um, the safe limits are 10 drinks a week for women and 2 drinks a day. And that's if a woman isn't pregnant. And when it says in the guidelines, as far as drinking, uh, throughout pregnancy, there is no safe amount to drink during pregnancy. So really zero alcohol is, um, the woman should not be drinking any at all. And I'm just wondering what-what are your thoughts on that?
Client: Well, you know, I've-I've heard these kinds of things before, but I just- I don't see the evidence. I don't see the risk, you know, I don't, you know, if someone can like prove to me, or show a direct link or something like that.
Therapist: So when you see it here in kind of black and white, you're not sure if this is, uh, you know, enough-
Client: It's the same thing.
Therapist: -to con- sort of convince you that-that it might be dangerous to be drinking through alcohol?
Client: Yeah. It's just a fancy little brochure saying what I've already known, I've already heard.
Therapist: So you feel like, um, what the doctor's saying and this brochure just kind of feels like, yeah, it's just kind of blowing things up out of proportion a little bit.
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: And it sounds like you-you've got some solid information already that alcohol, you know, has been safe to-to have during pregnancy. Tell me about that information that you've-you've explored.
Client: Um, well, I've looked up, um, different articles. Um, and I- as I said, I personally know people who haven't had any problems. Um, so that's about the extent.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. You mentioned you looked up some articles and it sounds like evidence is really important to you. So, um, those articles, is that something recent? Um, you can tell me about that.
Client: Like, uh, I don't like- have like a bibliography or anything.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: So I can't really- I don't really know when those were published. It's just stuff I've found, supporting the way that I look at it.
Therapist: So you felt like, um, the information that you found supports the values that you have of being able to be independent and autonomous, to be able to make your own choice and the information that your doctor shared or spoke to you about, and then this brochure kind of feels like that's challenging sort of your values.
Client: Yeah. Well, it's like all this brochure is saying is that, um, the same again, the same thing that I've heard, that the limits and that there is no safe amount of drink during pregnancy, but it's like, why not?
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: You know, it's kind of like the ""why"" that it's like-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -I never get that information.
Therapist: Wha-what's the big deal if you're drinking and—
Client: Yeah, like what kind of issues would that cause if any?
Therapist: Maybe we can kind of put that on the shelf for a moment, and we'll come back to it and sort of look at, you know, what is- what does the guidelines have to say about why. And, um, and-and I'm wondering if we can kind of just have a look for a moment at, um, your pregnancy, and is this something that you were- you were hoping to have a baby?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: That was something that you'd been planning?
Client: Yep.
Therapist: Okay. And I'm wondering as far as, um, bringing the baby into the world and, you know, your future as a parent, ho-how important is it to have a healthy baby to you?
Client: Um, well, it's-it's really important to me. That's a big priority of mine is to have a healthy baby and bring him or her up well and-and, you know, be a good parent.
Therapist: Mm. What does being a good parent look like? Tell me more about that.
Client: Um, not-not like being there at home with them, not being absent, um, taking care of them, feeding them, um, changing their diaper, which I'm not excited about. Um, you know, kind of the- those basics.
Therapist: Hmm. Kind of like protecting your baby and-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -guiding your baby and-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: -you know, nurturing that baby is really important to you-

Client: Yeah, I guess so.
Therapist: -on that. All right. So, I'd like to ask you, uh, kind of a scaling question about this 'cause I'm hearing that this feels really important to you that you'd be way up there on the high- on the high end of importance.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So, I'm gonna ask the question this way, on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is not at all confident, and 10 is like, ""I'm very, very confident,"" where would you put yourself on a scale right now of confidence in starting this new plan?
Client: Right now, I'm probably-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -gonna say a six.
Therapist: A six.
Client: But I know when I go home and I see the food, it's probably gonna drop back down to a four.
Therapist: Okay. All right. So, let's talk about that, um, so we should just assume we're gonna be at a four.
Client: Right?
Therapist: Okay?
Client: I guess.
Therapist: So, why are you at a four and not even a lower number? Why are you not like a zero or a one?
Client: Because I've been wanting to do this for-for years, like-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -ever since I started becoming conscious of my body.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Like ever since I started being a teen, like this has always been a goal of mine, like, especially 'cause all my friends play soccer, and like-
Therapist: Uh-huh.
Client: -hike, and are like super stick-thin but really healthy and active.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And so I'm just sort of like, well, I'm not.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: But I want to be like-- I don't want to be like stick-thin, but I really want to be like really healthy and really active.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And like be able to look nice, you know.
Therapist: Okay, all right.
Client: I wanna be able to look nice.
Therapist: Okay. So, what would help increase that confidence? What-- Because that sounds like where we really need to focus on. What's gonna help you feel more confident about this?
Client: I don't even really know-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -honestly. Like, I mean, I know I'm gonna have to keep like telling myself like-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -like this is something that you want- that you've wanted-

Client: -for years.
Therapist: Uh-huh.

Therapist: -so don't forget the nice car, and some kids, and be a- be a good dad-
Client: Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: -to your kids. So, is this dream starting to-- I am getting a picture of?
Client: Yeah, it'd be good.
Therapist: Yeah. Okay. So, what I'm really interested in is how offending fits in with that picture, that dream.
Client: I guess it doesn't.
Therapist: Yeah, how doesn't it fit, Billy?
Client: Uh, I guess I have to keep coming-coming back here and go into court and stuff.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah. It kinda messes things up.
Therapist: Yeah. It kinda messes up that dream, that picture?
Client: Yeah. It makes it harder.
Therapist: Mm. Makes it harder? Yeah. Well, it can make it harder to keep a job, aye?
Client: Mm.

Here are a few examples.

Examples:

Example 1
Client: But-but the wheezing is something that I've definitely noticed a little bit.
Therapist: I guess I also wonder whether, regardless of-of if your asthma symptoms are connected to Oscar, that may be part of you feels like it's worth it because he's been-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: -such a big part of your life for so long.
Answer: complex

Example 2
Client: Um, I'm just- yeah I just like to have a few drinks. I mean, you know, obviously, I-I have, uh, this diagnosed condition, and-and I think, you know, if I were able to, you know, maybe take a few hits off of the joint and have a couple of beers, I think that's about the same as taking the medicine.
Therapist: Well, you know, what, I-- There are a lot of people that wouldn't disagree with you on that exactly. You know, so, um, uh, but I know that they-they were never quite sure how they were all interacting all together. Like the, um- the weed kind of tends to make people a little paranoid anyway.
Client: Yeah, I-I-I got to be careful with it. If I take more than a hit or two of it, it-it-it can be a bit of a problem.
Therapist: Yeah. Why, what happens if you take a little too much of it?
Answer: none

Example 3
Client: That's a good way to sum it up. And it's-- Well, you understand it, uh, it's just- it's not good.
Therapist: Mm. So, and then you said, you don't like how it makes you act, um, if you can tell me a little bit about that.
Answer: simple

Example 4
Client: Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know.
Therapist: But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?
Answer: complex

Example 5
Client: I wanna stay friends with them. I don't want- I don't want them to just-
Therapist: You don't wanna lose your support group, yeah. You just wanna them to support you in being healthy, while helping them, raising the babe, and so we're just taking path B. You don't wanna lose them, just maybe the lifestyle it sounds like.
Answer: none

Example 6
Client: Um, I mean, I guess- I guess I need some strategies for figuring out how to ease stress without, I guess, getting high.
Therapist: Okay. And that's a very good reason for being here. Um, can you talk to me about maybe some of your-- the goals that you have?
Answer: none

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: Hi Billy. How are you doing?
Client: Yeah, I'm all right.
Therapist: Yeah. Hey, it's good to see you here and good to see you here on time. Yeah, it's really good to see a good start to the-- to your probation time with us here is to see you being here on time. So how did you get here today?
Client: Just caught the bus.
Therapist: Yeah, caught the bus to-to that-- to the stop outside the office?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah, okay. So I'm noticing that this isn't the first time that you've been to see someone at probation and it's not your first, um, community sentence. So I was wondering when you're sitting on the bus thinking about coming here, what was- what was going through your head about being here?
Client: Just a waste of my time.
Therapist: Just was feeling like, ""Ugh, it's gonna be a waste of my time coming here.""
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: Mmh. So how come you thought it was going to be a waste of your time? What was it based on?
Client: Last time didn't really work out that well.
Therapist: Yeah, didn't- didn't work out very well.
Client: Nothing really helped me.
Therapist: Okay. So you're hoping that it was gonna help you and it didn't. That was-- ended up feeling like a waste of your time.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Mm. So it sounds you're worried that it's gonna be a waste of your time this time too.
Client: Yeah, I'd say so.
Therapist: Mm, okay. So what sort of things do you think made it a waste of time last time?
Client: She didn't really listen to me, just told me what to do. She just bossed me around.
Therapist: Okay, the probation officer we're talking about here?
Client: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Therapist: Mm. So it felt like she bossed you around, didn't really listen to you.
Client: Yeah, she didn't really care.
Therapist: Okay, so actually having someone listen to you and hear about what you're saying is important to you?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Mm. So what's it gonna be like do you think working with me 'cause I'm also a female probation officer? Um, I'm wondering what-what's it gonna be like do you think?
Client: I-I don't care that you're a woman. It's just- it's that you don't know what it's like to be me.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: You have a different upbringing and live in a different place of town. Just-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -you wouldn't understand.
Therapist: Okay, and all of those things are true.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: You're right. I don't know what it's like to be you and what I'm getting a sense of is that it's actually important that the person sitting opposite you in this role needs to understand what it's like to be you. Is that right?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah, okay. So I guess the invitation for both of us really over the next few months of, um, on the sentence is for us to get an understanding about what it's like to be you.
Client: Yeah, so it is.
Therapist: Yeah, okay. So in terms of the things that have brought you here, in terms of the things that have got you into trouble and got you into offending, I'm wondering how interested you are in, um, really getting an understanding of it. So one or zero is like, ""Ugh, not interested at all.""
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: 100 is like, ""I'm totally interested and-and getting it nailed and sorted and, you know, getting on the straight and narrow."" Where would you be on that scale?
Client: Well, not too high. It's not like I'm out killing people or anything. It's just-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -silly stuff.
Therapist: All right. So it's kind of silly stuff that's getting you into trouble.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Is that what I'm hearing? Yeah. So in terms of dealing with it, where-where would you be, do you reckon? How interested would you be in dealing with that stuff?
Client: Mm, lots. When I stop getting caught. Don't wanna be back here again.
Therapist: Okay, so you don't wanna be back here. You don't wanna be sitting here and-
Client: No.
Therapist: -to talk to a probation officer again.
Client: No, sorry.
Therapist: Okay. So where would you be do you think?
Client: Mm, like what out of a scale it would like fall?
Therapist: Zero being, ""Argh, not interested at all,"" 100 being totally into it.
Client: Mmh, 25.
Therapist: 25, okay.
Client: Mmh.
Therapist: So I know that you're kind of 25% interested-
Client: Mmh.
Therapist: -and really thinking about what's got you into trouble and hence something about what gets you into trouble.
Client: Maybe but, mm, yeah, I wanna stop getting into trouble.
Therapist: You wanna stop getting into trouble.
Client: Yeah, but I don't think what I'm doing is that bad.
Therapist: Mm, okay.
Client: Just unlucky.
Therapist: Okay, so getting into trouble and, uh, getting caught and-and we see [unintelligible 00:05:36] does about luck and this time being unlucky.
Client: Yeah, the cops just have it out for me.
Therapist: Yes, tell me a bit more about that, Billy? Kind of give me the [unintelligible 00:05:46] the cops have got it on for you?
Client: Just 'cause growing up dealing with them and my mates and stuff and there's, you know, guilty before charged or whatever.
Therapist: Mm, so it feels like you always seemed singled out and, um, end up being unlucky.
Client: Yeah, me and my mates always get singled out.
Therapist: Okay, so you get singled out and that's what, um, means that you end up getting-- having to go to court and get sentenced and end on probation.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah. So I'm wondering, um, if there are things that you think, ""Well, I can see that that's got me into trouble,"" and, you know, kind of cops aside, things that might have got you into-into trouble.
Client: Just jacking cars and just stealing just, like, stuff and smokes and got done for that.
Therapist: Mm-hmm, okay. So some stuff that you can think, ""Oh yeah, I had, you know, I did some stuff that yeah, got me into trouble.""
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: It wasn't perhaps about the police singling you out. So those little things, well, you think, ""Mm, yeah, maybe-maybe if I'd done something differently, I wouldn't have ended up in trouble."" How interested are you in thinking about those things and-
Client: Yeah, well, I-
Therapist: -trying to get a handle on that.
Client: -wanna stop getting in trouble. Don't wanna-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -end up in prison for the rest of my life for doing stupid little things.
Therapist: Okay, so you don't wanna end up kind of being in prison again 'cause you've done some time inside. Yeah, and you don't wanna end up going back to prison, yeah. So-so that's one thing about wanting to make a difference and the way things are at the moment, yeah.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Cool. What else would, um, would help to kind of keep you out of trouble do you think?

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: Hi, Billy.
Client: Hi.
Therapist: Hi, another session and another session where you are actually on time.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: You've done-- You've got a really good track record of, uh, being on time. Yeah? Do you realize that?
Client: Yeah, no, it's easy.
Therapist: Yeah. Yeah. You know, I've been thinking about, um, thinking about you, and thinking about, um, that first meeting we had, and where you are now. So, wh-what do you think some of the changes are that-that you've made in this- in this, sort of, five-five to six weeks that we've been meeting?
Client: Uh. Meeting's definitely helped.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah. It's helped-
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: -heaps.
Therapist: It's helped heaps?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah? So, what sort of things has it helped with?
Client: Just, uh, someone to talk to and just someone to keep me busy and, kind of, keep me in check.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. So, what changes have you made, Billy?
Client: Um, well, I said I went to the polytech and stuff-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -and I went back there and got another form and stuff, and just helping me with that.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah. And, get-getting to the polytech and getting the forms, that's a pretty big deal.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah? I was thinking about the Billy, say, the Billy of six months ago. I'm wondering if the Billy of six months ago would've done that?
Client: Nah. I didn't really think about it frankly.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. So, what shifted that made it that you were actually able to go to the polytech and get the forms? What's shifted in you?
Client: I don't know. I just thought if, uh, I could get a job and stuff, doing stuff I like, uh, it'll make things easier.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah. Where have you got to with the forms? I mean, we talked about that quite a lot last time.
Client: Yeah. Oh, I know. After talking to you, I got Donna to help me out, and that's just really helpful.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: [clears throat]
Therapist: Okay. So, what did you say to Donna?
Client: [clears throat] Oh, I just said-- I said, ""Uh, could you give me a hand with this?""
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: And, like, she filled them up for me, and I told her what to write.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. So, where did you get to in terms of telling her that, uh, reading and writing is not that [unintelligible 00:27:23] for you?
Client: Just-- I-I asked her to fill that out for me because I said I'd be too messy.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So, I was thinking about how that stuff about not feeling confident around reading and writing has, um, really got in the way for you.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And I mentioned that's somewhere where you don't feel so confident, and I'm wondering what it would be like to feel confident with reading and writing. What difference would that make to your life?
Client: Like, a big difference, but, like, it's not like I don't try.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Like, I'm just not really good with it.
Therapist: Yeah. Yeah, I can really see that you're making an effort. In fact, I can see that you're really making an effort in lots of areas, not just in terms of reading and writing.
Client: Yeah. Like [unintelligible 00:28:13] if I'd got into polytech and stuff, so I think that's good.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So, where are the forms now?
Client: They're still at home.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: Yeah. If—
Therapist: So, what needs to happen next?
Client: Just take them in.
Therapist: So, you actually have to deliver them to the polytech, do you?
Client: Yeah. Uh, I think you can post them, but I'll just drop them in.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. So, when do you think you're gonna do that?
Client: Uh, probably by the end of this week.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. So, by the end of this week, so by next time, when you come here, as in, those forms will be at the polytech?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And what-what happens next in terms of what happens once the forms are there?
Client: I don't know. I don't know if you have to interview or whatever, but I guess, course-- I don't even know any course that I'll do.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. So what's the- what's the-- Say, if you get on the course-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -and, um, you're, like, real good with, uh, hands-on stuff, but the stuff around the manuals, and the assignments, and those sorts of things, um, don't feel so good. What-what do you think we need to do around helping you with that?
Client: Well, um-- Well, I don't know. Hopefully, there's not so much of that stuff. Um, oh, well, I don't know. I could find out maybe someone who can help you, like, at the school, at the polytech, maybe somebody can help you out and stuff, or there might be computers there or something.
Therapist: Mm. Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So, all these changes that you've- that you've made, um, Billy, where-where is the offending fitting into all of that now?
Client: Not really fitting in. It kind of just gets in the way.
Therapist: So, offending gets in the way of the life that you're starting to lead?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah? So, what temptations have you had to, kind of, go back to offending?
Client: Like like getting on the piss, but with Donna, there kind of keeps me busy.
Therapist: Mm. So the drinking is something that we talked about can make it easier for you to offend.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So you've noticed that when you've been drinking that those feelings are coming back again, or?
Client: Yeah. I just wanna have a bit of a laugh and like go smash some windows or go and nick a car or something, but yeah. It's kind of harder to think straight.
Therapist: It's harder to think straight when you've been drinking?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah. Yeah. And so you've got Donna around at the moment?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And that's helping keep you in check, as you said?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah. What would happen if she wasn't around say or at a party or?
Client: I'd probably just go be stupid with my mates.
Therapist: Okay. So Donna at the moment who kind of being there is like a strength?
Client: Yeah. 'Cause if there's just like if a mate said they're gonna go out and pick a car or something, she just bumps them out and then-then I don't know. She say that's stupid and stuff. And I don't know. It gives me something to do.
Therapist: Mm. What do you think?
Client: Just kind of stupid. Well, it's pointless, but still a bit of a laugh.
Therapist: Mm. Yeah. 'Cause I was thinking about that dream that you've got about the job and a life with Donna and-
Client: Mm.
Therapist: -kids and stuff like that and how you were saying that the offending doesn't fit in with that dream or that idea.
Client: No.
Therapist: So there's that on the one hand, but on the other hand, there's the kind of immediate, um, feeling when you've had a few to drink and you're with your mates and it feels like it would be a bit of a laugh?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So you've got-got those two things going on at the same time. Yeah?
Client: Mm.
Therapist: And it sounds like sometimes when you're in there with your mates and had a few drinks, it's hard to hold on to that vision of the future.
Client: Yeah. You don't really think about that. Well, just in the moment.
Therapist: Okay. So what-wh-- in the moment, what are you thinking?
Client: Just have a bit of fun. Not really thinking.
Therapist: Not really thinking or simply not thinking beyond the next-
Client: Mm.
Therapist: -kind of minute or so-
Client: No. Just, like, it's not normally my idea, like someone else would just suggest it and you kind of just, yeah.
Therapist: So it's not your idea. And you also go along with it?
Client: Yeah. You can't really be like, ""Oh no,"" just give me shit.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. What would happen if you say no?
Client: Just like, it can be shit and I still do it. They just-just call me a pussy or whatever and I don't know. And they'd talk me into it probably.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. So it's hard to actually say no to your friends-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -'cause of what they- what they thought of you.
Client: They'd just think I was joking, yeah.
Therapist: Yeah. So I'm wondering what the-the thinking, 'cause, um, one of the things that's really changed for you is being with Donna.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So I'm wondering, you know, most of them butt-butts head on your friendships with those- with those guys.
Client: I don't see them as much, but like she gets along with them aye, so-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: I don't think, like, I am not sure they like it.
Therapist: Then so when you're-- so you're spending less time with them and more time with Donna?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah. And you're saying you're kind of hanging out with her and going to movies and stuff? Yeah. And that means you're spending less time with your-- with those people that have actually led you in trouble in the past?
Client: They don't lead me into trouble. But-
Therapist: Okay. So tell me- tell me what it is that they do so I get a better understanding of it.
Client: Uh, like it's my choice though, they don't make me.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Yeah. I know it's just having grown up with, it's just what we've always done.
Therapist: Okay. So that's just what you've always done.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: But we're also talking about this idea that it doesn't fit with what your goals are or what your hopes are?
Client: Mm.
Therapist: Yeah. Mm. How would you like it to be?
Client: My life? Well, what do you mean?
Therapist: Mm, well the stuff about when you're in the moment. Yeah.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: When you've had a few drinks and you kind of go and get into trouble. How would you like that to be different?
Client: I don't know. Just more or less like if Donna was there and maybe if my mates got some girlfriends or something like that would calm them down too.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: So just hang out instead of go and do stuff, like stupid stuff.
Therapist: Okay. So-so Donna's helped calm you down and you'd like, um, them to calm down too?
Client: Yeah, 'cause then we could hang out together and stuff-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -with our girlfriends and stuff.
Therapist: So am I hearing that it's tricky in some ways to hang out with them sometimes-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -now that you're with Donna?
Client: Yeah. Cause I like I feel guilty not spending my time with, yeah, Donna. Like, I miss my mates, like, I get lonely and stuff, but even though they get me into trouble, but-
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: -just, kind of, feel stoked that-that I see them on the weekends and stuff.
Therapist: Okay. So-so what's the definition, for you, of a good mate?
Client: It's, like, loyal-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -yes, someone who's got my back.
Therapist: So, someone who's loyal, someone who's got your back, yeah? What else? What else is really your definition of a really good mate?
Client: That's about it. It's-- yeah.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Someone who'll stand up for you.
Therapist: Oh, so, someone who'll stand up for you?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah? Yeah. Sounds like a really strong definition of a good mate-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -for you? So, I'm wondering about, um, whether good mates lead you into trouble, if it's something you wanna do. If you got something different that you wanna do, what would a good mate do in that situation?
Client: I mean, support me.
Therapist: Yeah. How-how would you wanna be supported, Billy?
Client: Just don't give me shit about, I don't know. Um, yeah, just, if I- if I don't wanna go do something, don't, like, don't give me shit about it.
Therapist: Mm. Okay, so that's-that's the kind of support that a really good mate would give you? It sounds-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -like these guys have been around for you-
Client: Yeah, yeah, they [unintelligible 00:36:38]
Therapist: -for quite some time, and they're really important to you.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah. Okay. So, I'm wondering how we can get to that point where, yeah, you can say, ""No, I don't wanna do that,"" and they're supportive of you?
Client: Mm.
Therapist: What do you think it would take?
Client: Just they know that I'm serious.
Therapist: Okay. So, how would they know you're serious?
Client: I guess, like, if they actually know I'm going to polytech and stuff that they might understand.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: But, like I feel guilty if they wanna go and have fun, and I'm not with them.
Therapist: Okay. That's the second time you've used that word 'guilty'.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah? So, it sounds like it's a really-- something's really important to you about that.

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: Hi, Nick. Thank you for completing the CRAFFT questionnaire. I also appreciate you sharing some information about yourself.
Client: You're welcome.
Therapist: sI see from the questionnaire, did you have got in trouble while using alcohol? Can you tell me more about that?
Client: Well, a friend and I would snuck out one night to go to the park, and we got a couple of beers from his house, but the cop came by, and so we threw them in the bushes. He was originally gonna give us a curfew ticket but ended up not to. Luckily, he didn't see the beer.
Therapist: That must be really scary.
Client: Yeah, it was. If my mom would have found out, she would've killed me.
Therapist: I understand. So tell me, how often do you drink?
Client: Well, I've only tried drinking once or twice.
Therapist: I'm gonna make sure I understand. You have tried drinking a couple of times, and you almost got in trouble once. Did I get that right?
Client: Yeah, that's right.
Therapist: As your provider, I'm a little concerned about your health. Drinking alcohol could harm you, and I would like to share some information with you. Is that okay?
Client: Well, I'm not sure if this information is for me, since I've only been drinking once or twice.
Therapist: I understand. You're just experimenting with alcohol. Then, how about if you share with me what the effects of alcohol are?
Client: Well, all I really know is that it's not good for you.
Therapist: Are you surprised what that might be true?
Client: Yeah, and a couple of my friends drink too.
Therapist: Well, you might not be drinking that much, and other kids are also trying alcohol. I'd like to share with you the risk of using. Alcohol and drugs could really harm you because your brain is still changing. It also-- you're very high risk for becoming addicted. Alcohol and drugs could also interfere with your role in life and your goals, especially in sports, and it could cause unintended sex. How do you feel about this information?
Client: I really didn't think about how this would affect me playing sports.
Therapist: Based on your reason for your visit today, I feel like you really wanted to play soccer, and you have great goals about that.

Client: Mm.
Therapist: Yeah. And you have some ideas about that and some experiences about that. So today I wanna- be good for us to talk about that and, um, I'm really interested to know what you've been thinking about in terms of what you may wanna change in your life 'cause we're gonna be working together for a while here.
Client: Right. Neat. What, um, what have I changed, what am I—
Therapist: What you've been thinking about, um, over the last little while about getting your life back on track. 'Cause I noticed you've—
Client: I've been thinking about how easy it would be to deal P again.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I've been thinking about, um, how I could actually set myself up the right way doing it the wrong way.
Therapist: Sure. So what I'm picking up is-is that-that-that's a life that you know a lot about.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: And you can make lots of money and set yourself up well. What's the other side, because I guess when I talk to guys like yourself who have done time, often they're thinking about actually, mm, maybe life can be with different. So I'm wondering where-where you're at with the kind of thinking about—
Client: Well, at the end of, you know, that last week inside, I was- I had that kind of, okay, what's next buzz? And, you know, it just doesn't work out here.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: I don't have a, uh, uh, I don't know what that is.
Therapist: Sure. So life on the outside is pretty different than the kind of-
Client: Yes.
Therapist: -the expectation of life on the inside something?
Client: Yeah, it's worse.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So tell me how you've been managing. 'Cause I don't know if you'd been back dealing? How have you been managing to-to-to—
Client: I haven't yet, I mean-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -the, uh, the offer's there.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Um, I don't know why I haven't said that I will yet but I mean-
Therapist: Uh, tell me-
Client: -it's there.
Therapist: It's there and-and-and you've a lot of contacts?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: You've been in the system, so lots of context. So this isn't a new challenge for you.
Client: No.
Therapist: So what stopped you over the last-- How long have you been out now?
Client: How long have I been out?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Three weeks, one day.
Therapist: Three weeks, isn't it?
Client: Three weeks, one day.
Therapist: So what's been there? What's it about that you haven't done in three weeks one day?
Client: I don't know.
Therapist: 22 days you've actually made a decision not to-to pick up your old life and continue on.
Client: Um, I'd- I- you know, I kind of told myself not to, you know, just before I left. And then I'm just kind of with it and I don't quite know why. [clears throat] I dunno, if, uh, there's no real reason why I haven't yet. It's just that I don't- I just don't think it'll work the way I always dream it will you know, I see myself up like, whatever, if I do that again, the next leg is a long one. A real long one.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And I-I can't go back there. There's no way I'm going back there.
Therapist: Right. So the one hand you've-you-you could sit yourself up and-and take the risk, but on the other hand, you know, that actually it might not last?
Client: No, never lasts.
Therapist: Never lasts. Mm. You seem like a bit of a crossroads to me.
Client: Yep. I've been in crossroads for 12 years.
Therapist: Mm. But there've been times when those crossroads would be more sort of focused than other times.
Client: Yeah. And- [crosstalk]
Therapist: Yeah. And it sounds like maybe like-
Client: -sort of opposite, yeah.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: You know, we're in the middle, you know, and it's actually at the moment, I guess.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But I don't know. You know, that's quite clear that no fucking idea.
Therapist: Okay. Okay. So—
Client: Do you have an idea?
Therapist: No. Well, I've-I've got lots of ideas, but I'm really interested to hearing your ideas kind of first though because you know, and there might be some things that we can work on.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: But I guess what I'm really interested in is-is you've made a commitment 22 days, drug-free. Haven't gone back into that lifestyle. What-what's keeping you, 'cause you're at the crossroads, you kind of just pause there at the moment. I'm not sure about this other bit over here. What keeping you in that place?
Client: Fiona?
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Tell me about Fiona?
Client: She's told me that it's over if I do it. You know, I mean, she-- What tell you about, Fiona I mean she's been with me. She's the one who stayed through all the shit. And I owe her-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -something.
Therapist: Okay. So you've been with Fiona for how long?
Client: 12 years.
Therapist: 12 years. Okay. So she's stood by you then for the time, [crosstalk] but this time she said, it happens again I'm out of here?
Client: Yeah. She's actually got the black and white line down now.
Therapist: Okay. And it sounds like you're listening to that black and white line.
Client: It's pretty she- you know, she could be pretty full-on.
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: Yeah, so it's hard to ignore that line.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean. And it comes with a whole lot of different rules, and you know, she's never been quite like she is now.
Therapist: Okay. So something's changed in your relationship between you, yeah?
Client: Yeah. I think she has. I don't think I have.
Therapist: Okay. So what's Fiona want you from you?
Client: She just wants me. I mean, she just wants someone to be there. Me. She-she remembers me and she wants- she wants him.
Therapist: She wants him. So which him does she want, Daryl?
Client: The one that, you know—
Therapist: Does she want the- did she want the-the him that she fell in love with and saw great things in?
Client: Yeah, that's the one.
Therapist: Or does she want the-the-the-the him that's- that keeps on getting into trouble?
Client: No, no. No one would want him. I don't want him. He's a fuckwit, right? She wants the one that she fell in love with.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So what's it gonna take to reclaim this Daryl that she fell in love with?
Client: If I had the answer to that, I wouldn't need to be sitting here.
Therapist: Sure, yeah.
Client: And I mean, I honest- I don't know, man. I don't know. I-I wish I knew somewhere I could start that, you know, could give it to her, but I-I can't. I-I don't know.
Therapist: All right. Well, let's-let's just play with this idea a little bit, Daryl. So what did Fiona fall in love with? What were the qualities of Daryl that she said, ""This is him""?
Client: I was pretty romantic. I mean, I was pretty quite smooth, and, um, you know, I was on top of my game, like, she- and she loved it. And we used to laugh in the [unintelligible 00:06:45], you know? And just- it was always really sweet, and people used to say, ""Oh, man, you two. You two have just got it,"" you know? And we lost it, so whatever that was, that's what she wants. We were young. How do you become young? Uh, you know, I'm old, and we'll keep growing old, but you know?
Therapist: I know.
Client: Like if I'm not careful, I will be.
Therapist: Sure. Everyone will age, but that will happen on time.
Client: Yeah, certainly.
Therapist: Um, but that's okay. So-so it's she fell in love with this, the sense of fun, the sense of Daryl, and things have changed, but she's still with you?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah. And you're still with her?
Client: Yeah, yep.
Therapist: Yeah. So catch me up with the conversations you've had with Fiona about this crossroads you're at. You know, these 22 days, you haven't gone back, you've coming out and you're not back? You could pick up this dealing quite easily and probably some workout here tomorrow and get back into it.
Client: You know what? She hasn't even talked about the dealing, like, she won't even broach that subject. That's how black and white she is. She's- she'll be- she offers suggestions, you know? What I could do, and- or I kind of go with that, but none of them are-- You know, it's lovely that she's really finding things, but they're not the things. I mean, it-- I started kind of placating her and making it okay to keep giving me suggestions, but like, I need to come up with something because it's like awesome love, but you know, not in love, and she's getting sick of it already.
Therapist: Okay. All right. So-so back together, things are starting to get tense at home, and your relationship a little bit?
Client: A little bit that. Yeah, little-little bit tense. Yeah, that's fair.
Therapist: Yeah. Don't put words in your mouth. I'm sure if that is—
Client: No, they are.
Therapist: Oh, yeah? Yeah?
Client: I mean, not like they have been because we've only just started on the new road, but I mean, yeah, tense is the right word.
Therapist: Second, I'd like to talk, Daryl, about this all- whole idea, that's this crossroads idea, yep? So on the one hand here, you've got this 12 year history of being in the other system and done some time and being away from Fiona, but you're now back, sitting back together, and you've got some choice about where to go. So, in that 'where to go', what ideas have you been thinking about in terms of where this-this Daryl, non-dealing [crosstalk] guy—

Client: I would say an eight.
Therapist: You'd say an eight. Okay. And on a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you at the present time that you can drink below risk levels?
Client: I would say a four.
Therapist: Amount of four.
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: Okay. And so let's look at those two. You're-you're thinking it's pretty important, but your confidence is down here, uh, a four, but it's not a one. What makes you confident that you can drink below risk levels and you remember what those are?
Client: Um, I think it's because you've told me I'm at risk and I have alcoholism in my family and I really don't want to go down that path. So I'm-I'm confident that I can change that at this point.
Therapist: Okay. So that gives you a good reason not to drink. Okay. Anything else?
Client: Um, well, I have a group of friends that doesn't drink that I hang out with. And I think when I hang out with them, it's not an issue. So that also helps me.
Therapist: So you have a support group that gives you the ability to have fun and still drink below risk levels?
Client: Yep.
Therapist: Okay. Anything else?
Client: Nope.
Therapist: Now let's look at your self-evaluation of your birth control. So now we're doing the risk of pregnancy and the use of birth control. So on a scale of 1 to 10, how important is it to you to use effective birth control every time you have sex to keep from getting pregnant?
Client: I would say an eight.
Therapist: An eight. Okay. And on a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you at the present time that you- that you can use effective birth control?
Client: Every time,-
Therapist: Every time.
Client: -probably a six.
Therapist: Correctly as it's prescribed.
Client: Probably a six.
Therapist: Probably a six. Okay. So you're pretty confident that you can do it. And why are you a six and not a two or three?
Client: Um, I'm a six because I think if I drink less, I'll be more reliable with using birth control. I tend to not use it when I'm-- I drank too much and I don't really care too much.
Therapist: Okay. So it's kind of linked to your drinking, the fact that, um, that you can-- if you can take care of that drinking, you can take care of the-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -birth control issue and this importance comes down as your reason why you're not down here.

Therapist: Well, you know, what, I-- There are a lot of people that wouldn't disagree with you on that exactly. You know, so, um, uh, but I know that they-they were never quite sure how they were all interacting all together. Like the, um- the weed kind of tends to make people a little paranoid anyway.

Answer: none

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: So I wrote a prescription for antibiotics for Aiden.
Client: Okay.
Therapist: Um, I did wanna talk to you though. I'm a little bit concerned looking through his chart of how many ear infections he's had recently. And I-I noticed that you had checked the box that someone's smoking in the home. So I was wondering if you can tell me a little more about that.
Client: Well, um, It's just me and him and I do smoke. Um, I try really hard not to smoke around him, but I-I've been smoking for 10 years except when I was pregnant with him. But it-- everything is so stressful being a single mom and-and my having a full-time job. And so it's just-- that's why I started smoking again.
Therapist: You have a lot of things going on and smoking's kind of a way to relax and destress.
Client: Yeah. Some people have a glass of wine. I have a cigarette.
Therapist: Sure. And it sounds like you're trying not to smoke around him. Why did you make that decision?
Client: I know it's not good for him. I mean, I've read those things about ear infections and asthma and stuff and-and, uh, but other kids have ear infections and their parents don't smoke.
Therapist: So on the one hand, you're worried about how your smoking might be affecting him and on the other hand, you're not so sure if it's really the smoking that's causing these problems?
Client: Right. Yeah. I mean, he doesn't have asthma. Yeah. He-- I don't-- he hasn't had a lot of other problems that his other friends have, so. And I've thought about quitting before in the past, but I just don't- I just don't see how it's possible right now.
Therapist: What made you decide to quit smoking when you were pregnant?
Client: Well, he was inside me and we were sharing everything and I knew that he would get some of that. And I didn't-- I just didn't-didn't think I could live with myself if something happened to him.
Therapist: Right now, though, it feels almost too difficult to even manage or even to try?
Client: Yeah, exactly.
Therapist: How were you successful when you quit before?
Client: I don't know. I-I think about it now, I don't even know how I did it. I just- I just did it. You know, I just- I just couldn't imagine like him not being born or going into labor early-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -and-and him having problems and stuff like that, all the stuff that they talk about with women who smoke. So I-- that was just enough to-to say, ""Okay, you know what, I'm-I'm not going to risk that."" so.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. The risks were so scary then that you were able to stop?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: But they don't feel as scary to you now?
Client: No, I mean, we're two separate people. And like I said, I don't, I try really hard not to smoke around him. I'm pretty good about that. I-I don't let other people smoke around him. Um, so I, you know.
Therapist: You're doing the best you can do.
Client: Yes.
Therapist: Okay. But it sounds to me too like part of you really does want to quit?
Client: Yeah. I-I know that I need to, and I, you know, keep every new year I say, ""Okay, this year I'm gonna quit smoking"" but then something happens and it-it just doesn't. And quitting doesn't happen.
Therapist: It's on your to-do list. It's just not making it to the top?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: If you did decide to quit on a scale of 1 to 10, where 1 is not at all confident, and you don't think you could do it and 10 is you feel pretty certain that you could, where do you think you fall right now?
Client: Probably like a 5 . Kind of in the unsure area. Like I know I've done it before, so I know I can do it, but at the same time, it just seems really hard. And it's not the same situation.
Therapist: Well, what made you say five rather than two or three?
Client: I know- I know all the ways it's bad for me. And I don't want him to grow up thinking that it's okay to smoke. I don't want him to-to use any kind of-- I don't want him to chew or anything like that. Um, so I know I need to, especially before he gets old enough to understand what mommy's doing, but I just don't know if I can do it.
Therapist: Okay. So it sounds like you have a lot of reasons why you'd like to quit. You have been successful quitting in the past, and right now you're just feeling a little bit hesitant about your ability to do it?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Where do you think we should go from here?

Therapist: So, I'm gonna ask the question this way, on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is not at all confident, and 10 is like, ""I'm very, very confident,"" where would you put yourself on a scale right now of confidence in starting this new plan?
Client: Right now, I'm probably-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -gonna say a six.
Therapist: A six.
Client: But I know when I go home and I see the food, it's probably gonna drop back down to a four.

Client: You-you can- you can understand why I don't take it.
Therapist: To tell you, it sounds terrible, actually. Yeah. So, that that-that really-- And then- and then, to top it all off, literally, I mean, no sex drive.
Client: Right-right.
Therapist: And-and your wife, what does she have to say about that?
Client: Well, she wants to know who I am and what did I do with her husband.
Therapist: Yeah. Where's Scott? Where did- where did Scott go? That feisty, spirited guy, where- where'd he go?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: With the libido out the door.
Client: Yeah. And, uh- and so, she-- Actually, she-- When I first went on the medicine, she thought I was maybe messing around with somebody else, 'cause, I-I just wasn't interested in it at all.
Therapist: Oh, okay.
Client: I canceled my subscription to the spice channel.
Therapist: I didn't even know they had a spice channel. [chuckles]
Client: I don't know if they still have it or not. [chuckles]
Therapist: So they-- So, um, before you started taking the medication, though, when she was, you know, um-- Even though now she's like, ""Where is my old Scott,"" and stuff, well, were there any times when she wanted you to go on the medication? And, if so, what-what prompted those?
Client: Well, if I stay off the medication too long, I-- Some people might say there's a problem with that, you know.
Therapist: You were right.
Client: Well, I guess running around the neighborhood with no clothes on isn't really good.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Um, I thought I had a, uh—
Therapist: Might get you into trouble [unintelligible 00:05:06]
Client: Yeah, well, I thought I had my gym shorts on, but they said that I didn't.
Therapist: Okay. What else?
Client: Well, I-I ended up in the hospital.
Therapist: What do you think about the hospital?
Client: Don't like that hospital.
Therapist: No.
Client: Uh. [clears throat] I'm not sure that the hospital is worse than the cotton ball, but I don't like it either.
Therapist: So, you'd really like to stay out of that hospital?
Client: Well, I got a question for you. You're a doctor, why don't you guys come up with some- something else besides either being in the hospital or taking this stuff every day, can you come up with something? I mean, you guys, we put a man on the moon 50 years ago, I mean, and you still got to give me this stuff that makes me feel like a-a zombie with-- That hasn't had a drink or water in four days, it-it just doesn't seem right. Either you guys ought to come up with something better. That's what I think.
Therapist: I agree with you, I really do. So-- And I- and I think that a lot of times, um, the medications, they do have a lot of side effects, and I completely understand why people don't wanna take them-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yet, at the same time, I know running around and getting in trouble for being naked or having to go to the hospital, not such a good thing either. Um, I'm wondering if, um- if I could run some ideas by you that some other patients of mine have tried?
Client: I suppose.
Therapist: Okay, thanks. Um, we could if you're-- 'Cause, as you can tell, this is really more of an art than a science, um, try some other medications and see how you do on them, and perhaps, you won't have these side effects. And, um, it-it really is just a matter of kind of experimenting around to get, uh, to see if we can get to a point that at least you're not having these really bad things happen of getting into the hospital and getting arrested and stuff versus feeling more like that-that spirited Scott that, you know, watches Spice channel, you know, I mean-- Because I can tell the spirit of Scott is, uh, a hoot.
Client: Well. Yeah. Well, yeah, I-I'd like to. I don't know, is it-- Can you- can you drink with them, some of these other ones?
Therapist: Well, you know, uh, Scott, well, tell me a little bit since you brought that up. Yeah, obviously, drink and tell me a little bit about your [unintelligible 00:07:35]
Client: Well, I don't really drink like people-- Like some alcoholic or something but, I do—
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: I-I like to take the edge off-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: You know, with a few drinks, you know, not-not a lot, you know, and-and really-
Therapist: How-how often do you do that?
Client: Not every day.
Therapist: Maybe every other day?
Client: Maybe.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Maybe not, uh-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: You know, it's not all the time, it's-it's not- it's not a problem.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Certainly not a problem.
Therapist: How would you know if it was a problem?
Client: Well, if I was like getting arrested for drunk driving.
Therapist: So, if you got a DUI, you would really know.
Client: Well, that's what alcoholics do. I'm not an alcoholic.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Um, I'm just- yeah I just like to have a few drinks. I mean, you know, obviously, I-I have, uh, this diagnosed condition, and-and I think, you know, if I were able to, you know, maybe take a few hits off of the joint and have a couple of beers, I think that's about the same as taking the medicine.
Therapist: Well, you know, what, I-- There are a lot of people that wouldn't disagree with you on that exactly. You know, so, um, uh, but I know that they-they were never quite sure how they were all interacting all together. Like the, um- the weed kind of tends to make people a little paranoid anyway.
Client: Yeah, I-I-I got to be careful with it. If I take more than a hit or two of it, it-it-it can be a bit of a problem.
Therapist: Yeah. Why, what happens if you take a little too much of it?

Therapist: Okay, so you feel as if drinking is a problem for you at the moment?
Client: Yeah, it's just- it's just got worse over the last six months?
Therapist: Okay. Wh-What makes you say that it's gotten worse?
Client: Well, I guess, I drank, you know, like most people do before, um, but I broke up with my boyfriend, uh, about a year ago and then six months ago I guess I wanted to go out again and see if I can meet people.

Client: Um, to try to meet guys.

Client: Yeah. Well, I just, I don't feel comfortable talking to guys normally. [chuckles]

Client: Thank you.
Therapist: I'd say my name is Mark and I work here at Green Prescriptions. And-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: I know a little bit about you from the referral letter from the doctor.
Client: From my GP?
Therapist: From your GP, yeah.
Client: Uh.
Therapist: But before we get to anything, I'll probably want to just ask you a little bit about what's led you to come here today and get a bit of an idea about what's been going on for you.
Client: What's led me to come here?
Therapist: Mm.
Client: My GP.
Therapist: And what did he have to say?
Client: Well, um, you know, I had my sort of, uh, checkup.
Therapist: mm.
Client: And it revealed that apparently, I might have diabetes 2. Well, that's what he says.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Um, I-I think that I feel perfectly well. I-I'm, you know-- I understand people with diabetes are a little bit plumper than I am.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: But, um, that's really why I'm here. I'm on his command, almost.
Therapist: Right, so he kinda gave you a directive?
Client: Well, he did. He says he's going to put me on some sort of program if it gets worse.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: But as I say, I-I feel absolutely fine now.
Therapist: So it kind of came a bit of a surprise, you feeling okay.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: You go for this checkup with the doctor. And he says, ""You've got Type II diabetes.""
Client: Mm, I'm very surprised.
Therapist: Mm. Came out of the blue for you?
Client: Yes. I think it did.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: And you said you kind of don't fit that kinda Type II diabetes look. That you kinda have had this idea-
Client: I-
Therapist: -you've been-been overweight with it.
Client: That's what I understand.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: You know, and I'm not overweight.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I-I sort of look after myself to a limited extent in that way. Um, but I'm a busy person, I suppose I burn off the calories. And-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I don't know, really.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: My lifestyle—
Therapist: Hmm. So it doesn't quite fit in your head, Type II diabetes and-
Client: No.
Therapist: -your lifestyle?
Client: No, not at all.
Therapist: Comes as a big surprise. And what was your reaction when he told you that at the time?
Client: Well, I-I thought he must be joking. To be honest. I thought-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -you know, why you are-- Look around you.
Therapist: Mm, mm.
Client: um, I just felt that, um-- I mean, I don't think he was wasting my time because why would he do that?
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: Right?
Therapist: He's got a lot to do.
Client: Um-- Absolutely right.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: He's got a job to do. And obviously, the tests have come through. And I have got these signs of diabetes 2.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Right? Um, I just think that-- Well, I just don't feel like it, Mark.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Um—
Therapist: So how are you feel in your head-
Client: I feel absolutely fine.
Therapist: -and what the tests say kind of like don't join up.
Client: Yeah. Well, physically, I feel absolutely fine.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I'm-I'm-- I didn't see anything wrong with me at all.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: I mean, I get around, I sleep pretty well-
Therapist: Hmm-hmm.
Client: I sort of you know-
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: - I'm-I'm compos mentis. So I don't—
Therapist: Yeah. What's the problem? Mm.
Client: What is the problem?
Therapist: And how did this happen is probably kind of what you're also thinking. Well, how did this--?
Client: Well, uh, yes. I mean-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -I must admit, I haven't done too much research. I've been a bit busy.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Um, but he-he was saying something about, I don't know, family or whatever. I don't know.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And I don't know if it's hereditary.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I think he said something about it being hereditary.
Therapist: So he mentioned, it might be a family thing. And so you-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -maybe got from your parents or something of the sort.
Client: Yeah, it could be-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -because, um, my mother mentioned-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -that, uh, my father had diabetes-
Therapist: Right.
Client: -diabetes 2. And if I think about it, um, his brother-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -uh, I haven't seen him for years.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But he might well have it because he is-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -a pretty cuddly guy. You know-
Therapist: Right.
Client: He's pretty big.
Therapist: So he fits the picture-
Client: Well, yes, the stereotype,-
Therapist: -when you think about what he-he-- Yeah, he's stereotypical.
Client: Yeah, I guess.
Therapist: A little bit bigger, perhaps doesn't look after himself that well, and he fits that foot
Client: Well, yeah. I mean, as far as I know, I hadn't seen him for-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -I don't know how many years.
Therapist: Mm. So you got this knowledge as a witness there's some family history of diabetes in the past?
Client: Apparently so. Yes, apparently so.
Therapist: Doctor mentioned that as being a factor.
Client: Mm, I mean, it is hereditary, is it?
Therapist: That's certainly true. Yes. We know that people who've had parents or have been in the past, there is a hereditary factor or genetic factor in-involved.
Client: A genetic factor. And so, does that mean that if you've got, um, if you've got a history of this within your family-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -if it's a gene-- you are more likely than not to get it?
Therapist: Correct. Yeah.
Client: Also, it's—
Therapist: But it's not inevitable.
Client: Right. Okay.
Therapist: Because its genes or the-the-the-the hereditary factor is not the only factor that causes it or is involved in it happening to you. So there's other factors that come into play.
Client: I'm sure you're going to tell me what they are.
Therapist: Well, you've-you've mentioned some of the things you know, and one of those is hereditary factors. You mentioned that the doctor mentioned that. And what else do you know or have you heard? You say you haven't had a lot of time to do the research. What else? Other things you've.
Client: To be frank, Mark, I honestly don't know. I mean, I honestly don't know what causes it because I've never had any reason. It came upon me from the GP and it took me back.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, the hereditary thing I thought, well, maybe that's the explanation.
Therapist: That makes a bit of sense.
Client: And why go any further, it's there?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Can't help it.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: They live pretty long lives, they did, all right.
Therapist: They managed with it.
Client: Relatives relatively went into their 70s.
Therapist: Okay. I don't know if it'd be helpful for you if you'd like to know a little bit more about some of the factors involved in time Type II diabetes.
Client: Well.
Therapist: If that would help.
Client: If there's something that you think that-- Yes. Yes, of course.
Therapist: Well, I'll perhaps share with you what I know from working with other people and some of the things I've experienced in working with people.
Client: Okay.
Therapist: And see what you make of it. See if it fits a little bit more with where you're at. We know that there is a strong family factor or hereditary factor, so that's one aspect. So also it tends to happen a little bit later in life, rather than something you might get when you're a teenager, this type of diabetes. So-so it's a later onset. It takes a bit of time for it to develop maybe. And the main reason I think, um, the main aspect of it is that it, have you heard about insulin.
Client: I've heard of it yeah.
Therapist: So that's a hormone or a chemical, it allows you to utilize sugar in your body.
Client: Right.
Therapist: All right. And Type II diabetes typically people have a resistance or a resistance to insulin in their cells, in their fat cells or their muscle cells or liver cells. They can't use insulin. And so sugar builds up in your system.
Client: Are you saying that they-they like they can't digest insulin or is that?
Therapist: You need insulin in your cells, individual cells in muscle or in fat or wherever to, um, use up excess sugar or to utilize sugar.
Client: Oh, I see. So-so it's like a-it's like a balance.
Therapist: That's right.
Client: So insulin you-you.
Therapist: Kind of, as your.
Client: You have yourself draws bar.
Therapist: Yap.
Client: Or something, and then what balances that out in the body is the insulin taking off the excess.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Or-or digesting? Should I say the excessive sugars?
Therapist: That's a good way to think.
Client: Is that what happened?
Therapist: Exactly. And what's happening in Type II diabetes is your-your fat cells and liver cells and muscle cells are resistant to insulin. It's almost like they're saying we can't use that.
Client: Why?
Therapist: And if-- Well, there's a number of-- We're not entirely sure, there's a lot of research still going on as to how this happens and how that could be modified. But what we do know is that, um, one of the key things in managing it is to try and modify or modulate, control the amount of sugar that are in your system.
Client: Right. Okay.
Therapist: Yeah. So there's a couple of things that we know that people with Type II diabetes have to look after and have to think about if they want to control the amount of sugar that's in their system, which is the main issue that's causing some of the health problems that people have with Type II diabetes. Too much sugar, and if it's not able to be utilized in the blood cell, in the fat cells, or liver cells, and the muscle cells stays in your bloodstream. And that can cause problems with your circulation. So too high blood sugar and too low a blood sugar can be a problem. So sugar is the main concern in Type II- Type II diabetes.And you mentioned earlier on, a couple of things that the doctor-- You've mentioned some signs that he was kind of a little bit concerned about. Well, what things did you notice over the-over the last month or so?
Client: You mean, personally?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Well, I didn't know. I mean, the thing is you see that-- I mean, I did think about this a little bit and I thought, well, over time, if things happen slowly, you don't really notice.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: As you get older.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I don't-I don't leap over five bar gates like I used to, you know, um, as opposed to, uh, running with the backs now, I tend to spend more time, you know, with my old mates in the bar.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: At the rugby club and-and-and the such like, yeah. And, um, the fish I'm hooking, I'm not after the kings anymore, I go for the snapper now, it's a bit easier, you know.
Therapist: A slightly more sedate lifestyle.
Client: Yeah, absolutely. You just do.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: You just do. Um, so you're less demanding, I guess, on your-on your body, you realize, and you don't really want to do these things anyway. You know, you let the youngsters get home.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Been there, done that. So you don't really notice. So I'm coming back to this diagnosis I had from my GP and him saying, ""You've got diabetes 2,"" well, I should feel like that, shouldn't I?
Therapist: Yeah. It should feel like there's something really wrong with you.
Client: Yeah, I mean.
Therapist: What's-how have you been feeling over the last month? So, you say you're very busy you're doing a lot of work.
Client: Yeah, I mean I'm a busy person. All right? I uh, my work uh, I work in insurance, so I'm always hopping from one place to another place.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, I haven't noticed.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: I really haven't noticed how, um, okay I get a bit--I suppose I get a bit out of breath sometimes.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: If I rush too much that-that's true. Um, I suppose, um, I don't go upstairs two at a time anymore, I use one at a time.
Therapist: So a little bit sort of energy is not quite there sometimes? The vitality.
Client: Oh, certainly the energy I have is-is not what I-what I had. I mean I do need to, you know, I'm busy but I do need to sit down, um, uh, I do need to sit down and relax with a cup of coffee, you know, and, uh, things.
Therapist: Yeah, Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, more than I would normally.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But that would be, that would be about it.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, is it getting worse? I don't know. I-I-I suppose. What worse? Is it-is it increasing? Well, to say, I don't really notice it.
Therapist: You haven't noticed it. So it's a progressive, you know, you've just seen this, as-as you got older, things have slowed down. You know those activities you used to do, but that's kind of like what happens.
Client: Yeah, yeah. Um, at least, that's what I think. I mean I don't know if you're telling me that I should be more active or my GP is saying I should be more active.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, as I say, uh, you know I-I don't do any regular form of exercise, I have to say, not anymore.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: But maybe I-maybe I don't know.
Therapist: Hmm, a bit of a mystery there.
Client: I mean I've got uh, well I-I mean I've got a great lifestyle. I mean if it's very-it-it's very good. I mean I've got all my mates in down at the rugby club. And I've got uh, you know even in the summer when that's a bit damn. I used to coach rugby and I coached cricket when I finished playing. So-so I've got the-the guys in the cricket club, um, you know, for the-for the, uh, for the summer evenings. And, uh, and then, uh, the-then, of course, we've got the fishing, and that's all of us combined. We're a big gang, really.
Therapist: Really? So what I'm hearing is there's actually a lot of aspects in your life which are really good.
Client: Oh, I think my life yeah. My life is great.
Therapist: From your perspective, things are going well?
Client: My life is great, and then you turn around and say, ""Hey you've got-- you-you're ill, you're sick.
Therapist: Yeah. It doesn't fit.
Client: And um, no I'm not. But you see, he said to me that he's gonna put me on some sort of, uh, a daily monitoring of, is it sugar levels?
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: And I'm gonna have to take regular pills.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Well frankly, the only pills I take are sort of paracetamols.
Therapist: Yeah. When you get uh, a headache.
Client: For a bit of the head in the morning, you know.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um.
Therapist: So the idea of having to test-test your blood sugar and take medications is kinda like off--
Client: Come on, you know.
Therapist: And you know that's a bit too-
Client: Well, life is too short.
Therapist: Too much.
Client: You know it's the truth.
Therapist: Yeah. Okay.
Client: I mean you know—
Therapist: And you're here today and that's probably something in you you've thought well I'll follow this through, you know I'll-I'll come along and see what-see what they've got to say. And I'm just wondering for this session, for the time we have today, there's a number of things we could talk about. You mentioned a couple of things about your lifestyle and, um, medication is one thing you've been told by the doctor you might need to do that. And a number of things that we could talk about today. Which-which area would you think would be useful for you to focus on?
Client: Well there is-there is something that you sort of prompted me to think about, and, um, I split up-- My wife and I, we split up several years ago now. And, um, you know we've been married for many many years.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: And um, I think she used to look after me because she used to do the cooking and-and-and stuff like that.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And I have to say that I'm not the best cook in the world.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, and-and being on the run all the time and you know once I get back home, it's, you know, it's time to go down to the rugby club or whatever it might be, uh, we're out with the mates. And, uh, I-I do I suppose my food is not as healthy perhaps as it used to be when she was around. She's moved down to Hamilton to live with her mother, if you've met her mother. Anyway, but, um.
Therapist: So then, since you've been on your own since you've separated, divorced and you've noticed that the things you eat and how you eat has changed.
Client: Yeah, I mean mates and their wives are pretty cool about it sometimes.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Because, you know, they'll invite me for dinner and so on.
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: And, yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess, you know, that's when you, well, or whatever reason, you split up in life.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You start looking at the home life of somebody else, you're thinking, ""Hmm, I use d to have this.""
Therapist: Hmm. Yeah, yeah.
Client: And you think, "" This is nice food, "" isn't it? and you know.
Therapist: Yeah. And your-- part of your wife used to do a lot of that for you?
Client: Oh, she would do all the cooking. Yeah, yeah,
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I never bothered to boil an egg in the water, you know.
Therapist: And so she would kinda look after what you ate and healthy things that you had, spread in front of you and off you go.
Client: Totally. I mean, I was just in charge of the wine, you know.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. And now you have to think about what you might eat and sometimes you don't eat the best.
Client: Well I-- This is what I'm saying. Maybe I'm not thinking about it. Maybe that's the thing.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Maybe I'm just—
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You know, because it-- you know this-- the pizza shop's just on the road.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And then there's-- I mean, okay, I confess that lunchtime, occasionally, it's uh, I'm hungry and McDonald's is very convenient
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -or Kentucky Fried or whatever.
Therapist: Very appealing, isn't it?
Client: You know, it's very easy. and then, um, then you think to yourself, well-- I mean, I do think of myself that maybe I should have a few vegetables around here or whatever. But then you go out into the supermarkets, you know, and you can pick up, uh, your- one of your TV dinners.
Therapist: Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm.
Client: So you bring those in and you open them up and put them in the microwave and there's vegetables there.
Therapist: Yeah they look pretty good on the plate, don't they?
Client: Yeah, it looks- it looks fine, you know, et cetera. I mean, so that will happen occasionally if I've got a night in. But cooking-wise, no, I haven't cooked anything, um, other than boil the water for the kettle for a cup o coffee.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -for ages.
Therapist: They're food choices in what you eat and what's in your diet it's not what-something you actually you've actually been aware of or had to think about in the past.
Client: Yeah. I do miss her breakfast. I have to say, we used to have get a nice breakfast.
Therapist: So one thing that you noticed is diet and the eating patterns and-
Client: Well—
Therapist: -when you eat. That's one aspect. What other aspects do you think you've-- you would be--?
Client: Well, I used to be quite a heavy smoker, right? I mean, I'd smoke a pack in a half a day. And I knew that wasn't doing me any good.
Therapist: Right.
Client: I mean the thing is when you're a-- I mean, I've always smoked. So, but when you're young and you're a sportsman, you know—
Therapist: You kinda juggle those two things and kinda--
Client: Well, the two things they balance out, you know and everybody else is
Therapist: You still run and have a cigarette?
Client: You know, you pass a cigarette down the backline almost, don't you? You know, just before the game gets—
Therapist: Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, part of the culture.
Client: Yeah, part of the of the whole thing. And it's changed a bit now, because in my day when we were playing, of course, it was a very much more of a social game, which was spent-spent in the rugby club.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: That's why you played and it was a big buddy-buddy thing.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: That was rugby and cricket was the same really.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Um, but now—
Therapist: But over the years, you've actually reduced your smoking or you've stopped altogether or at times?
Client: Well I-I, yeah. I was getting a bit sort of-- I was getting a bit, you know, a bit wheezy and I thought, ""I'll cut this out.""
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: But I enjoy smoking. I really do enjoy it. So I cut it down to I suppose it's about 10 a day now.
Therapist: Okay, so you meant to reduce.
Client: Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: You were noticing that it's having an impact on your breathing and health wasn't so good.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: When you related that to your smoking, so you managed to reduce your smoking.
Client: Yeah, yeah. I sort of—
Therapist: So you've made our decision to do that?

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: So, Chris, I wanted to talk to you. Um, you know, you're one of our star athletes. I really value you as a team player. As Athletic Director, one of my jobs is to, kind of, keep tabs on the players and make sure everybody is performing at their best. And something came up this weekend. I've been hearing some chatter about a big party that went down and understand you were there. And so I wanted to talk to you a little bit about how partying and alcohol fits in your life right now.
Client: Okay, oh, actually, could I confide something in you that has been bothering me lately. Well, prior to that party, like, as you know, I'm a honor student and my parents, like, they keep me very, like k-kept down out of the, like so- like social life.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: And, um, about a month ago, my friends invited me to a party. And they used the fact that, Oh, I'm always doing my homework, I'm always studying that to allow me to go to the party. And on-- well, that party, I managed to convince my parents that I would spend the night at my friend's house. So, that's when I started drinking.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: It was a- it was a unique experience, as you can say. I guess you can say. And, I don't know, I-- It was fun, at least, in the moment. So, I kept doing it. Then this past weekend, instead of studying for an exam, I asked my-- I begged my mom to let me go to another party. And she, kind of, knew what I was doing. She asked me to, like, to promise her of no alcohol, no drugs. Then I'll pick you up by 12:00. And I-I was surprised. 12:00-12:00, that's basically when the party starts, but I told her whatever-- I thought- I thought to myself that I'll-I'll come-- I'll figure out to delay her, can you pick me up later? So later, so she-- I promised that-- She dropped me off, I promised her no alcohol, no nothing. So I-- we go, I have fun like I've been having. And I was drinking. And then the time- the time came for her to pick me up. And as soon-- I couldn't delay her from picking me up. And as soon as she picked me up, and I stepped in the car, she said, ""You drank vodka."" And I'm like, I-I didn't know what to say. I just looked at the floor. And I-I feel terrible because I-I betrayed my mother. I broke my trust with her that she expected me not to indulge in alcohol. And that's exactly what I did.
Therapist: So, here you are. You're an honors student. You're a star athlete. You've, kind of, been doing everything you've been told for all these years, and maybe last month sometime, you started getting more involved in the party scene.
Client: Right.
Therapist: And it was fun at first. But now you're already noticing some consequences.
Client: Yes, right. Like I've been noticing I've been more lethargic and apathetic towards schoolwork.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: I haven't really-- I kind of just sit in class like-- I-- my mind is elsewhere, especially on the weekends, where instead of-- I was- I was instead of studying, I caught up with my friends, trying to find where we can-- I get alcohol based on their age and stuff like that.
Therapist: It's really changed your focus. What do you like about drinking?
Client: I don't know. It-It's because I'm a very reserved person, for the most part, not when- not when I'm dealing with sports or like-- you know, like a social environment. I tend to keep to myself because I'm very self-conscious, I would say. And when I- when I drink, I feel, I don't know, like, it relaxes me. I'm able to talk or engage with other people more easily. I don't know it just—
Therapist: So, it helps you, kind of, loosen up, feel more relaxed.
Client: Exactly.
Therapist: Sounds like you're noticing quite a few not so good things about alcohol though your mom got mad at you, you're having decreased focus, you're, kind of, not doing so well in school, maybe-
Client: Kind of.
Therapist: -or any other things?
Client: Just different groups, friends or groups, girlfriends, like different people that I'm hanging out with because certain people are associated with that type of scene.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: So, that-that-that's also changed.
Therapist: So, your-your friends that you were hanging out with, there's a little tension there now.
Client: A little bit because not all of them are into that. So, like, I'm in one group of friends, and I would talk to another person that's an another group of friends and they just happen to invite me to that first party.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: So, since then, I've been hanging out more with them, getting to know them. But I can also see that oh, I'm just living life, I guess. But that's also not fair to them that I'm not there for them as much as I was before.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: As they are there for me, you know.
Therapist: Well, given that you've sort of noticed all these changes where it's affecting your friendships, it's affecting your studying, it's affecting your relationship with your mom. Where do you think you should kind of go from here?
Client: Oh, um, I feel I should st-stop. I mean, like, I'm not-not unrealistic. I understand that situations like this will happen.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: It's just up to me not to take it so far, where I can't remember the night before, if I'm puking. All I remember is the toilet-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -that's-that's not worth it, either. And I have to slowly build back my trust with my mother because that was that's a big blow. It's little so I guess may seem to other people.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But to me then it's a big thing.
Therapist: Your mom is really important to you.
Client: Of course.
Therapist: And how she feels about you is important to you.
Client: Exactly.
Therapist: How important is it to you to make, uh, an adjustment in your drinking or even to quit?
Client: A lot at this point because I feel that's a big factor with gaining back my trust with my mother.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And also getting back on top of my school work again my athletics too.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: So I feel that there-there's a future in that.
Therapist: How confident are you that you could actually change your drinking or-or even cut down or quit?
Client: I'm pretty confident, especially.
Therapist: O-on a scale of 1 to 10 where one is not at all 10 is completely what number would you give.
Client: Probably like an 8 or 9.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And that can't be a ten there's nothing as ten in life I feel. Like there's too many factors but I feel like I'm determined to.
Therapist: Why did you say eight or nine rather than six or seven?
Client: Because I don't know I feel deter-determined to-to make sure this happens because I don't like how I felt after I-I betrayed my mother. I don't like remembering that the feeling of like vomiting.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: It's not a pleasant experience. Uh, it's not something that I wish to enjoy. So like even if I do drink, I don't want to drink to the point where that happens, like all the fun that I have and prior to that just it's not worth-it's not worth drinking.
Therapist: All right, what do you think's a realistic goal for you then?
Client: To make sure I have my studies. Well first, try to get-get back my trust with mother-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -then just focus on my studies. Then if I have time for leisure time like I'll go party with my friends and just be as a party with them doesn't mean I have to drink. And I do one cup is not going to do anything to my life either. But I'd prefer not to do that. I prefer just make sure.
Therapist: So your goal is kind of to do not drink at all or if you are at a party, uh, a maximum of one at the very most.

Client: Just caught the bus.
Therapist: Yeah, caught the bus to-to that-- to the stop outside the office?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah, okay. So I'm noticing that this isn't the first time that you've been to see someone at probation and it's not your first, um, community sentence. So I was wondering when you're sitting on the bus thinking about coming here, what was- what was going through your head about being here?
Client: Just a waste of my time.
Therapist: Just was feeling like, ""Ugh, it's gonna be a waste of my time coming here.""

Therapist: Okay. So you're hoping that it was gonna help you and it didn't. That was-- ended up feeling like a waste of your time.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Mm. So it sounds you're worried that it's gonna be a waste of your time this time too.
Client: Yeah, I'd say so.
Therapist: Mm, okay. So what sort of things do you think made it a waste of time last time?
Client: She didn't really listen to me, just told me what to do. She just bossed me around.
Therapist: Okay, the probation officer we're talking about here?
Client: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Therapist: Mm. So it felt like she bossed you around, didn't really listen to you.
Client: Yeah, she didn't really care.
Therapist: Okay, so actually having someone listen to you and hear about what you're saying is important to you?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Mm. So what's it gonna be like do you think working with me 'cause I'm also a female probation officer? Um, I'm wondering what-what's it gonna be like do you think?
Client: I-I don't care that you're a woman. It's just- it's that you don't know what it's like to be me.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: You have a different upbringing and live in a different place of town. Just-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -you wouldn't understand.
Therapist: Okay, and all of those things are true.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: You're right. I don't know what it's like to be you and what I'm getting a sense of is that it's actually important that the person sitting opposite you in this role needs to understand what it's like to be you. Is that right?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah, okay. So I guess the invitation for both of us really over the next few months of, um, on the sentence is for us to get an understanding about what it's like to be you.
Client: Yeah, so it is.
Therapist: Yeah, okay. So in terms of the things that have brought you here, in terms of the things that have got you into trouble and got you into offending, I'm wondering how interested you are in, um, really getting an understanding of it. So one or zero is like, ""Ugh, not interested at all.""
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: 100 is like, ""I'm totally interested and-and getting it nailed and sorted and, you know, getting on the straight and narrow."" Where would you be on that scale?
Client: Well, not too high. It's not like I'm out killing people or anything. It's just-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -silly stuff.
Therapist: All right. So it's kind of silly stuff that's getting you into trouble.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Is that what I'm hearing? Yeah. So in terms of dealing with it, where-where would you be, do you reckon? How interested would you be in dealing with that stuff?
Client: Mm, lots. When I stop getting caught. Don't wanna be back here again.
Therapist: Okay, so you don't wanna be back here. You don't wanna be sitting here and-
Client: No.
Therapist: -to talk to a probation officer again.
Client: No, sorry.
Therapist: Okay. So where would you be do you think?
Client: Mm, like what out of a scale it would like fall?
Therapist: Zero being, ""Argh, not interested at all,"" 100 being totally into it.
Client: Mmh, 25.
Therapist: 25, okay.
Client: Mmh.
Therapist: So I know that you're kind of 25% interested-
Client: Mmh.
Therapist: -and really thinking about what's got you into trouble and hence something about what gets you into trouble.
Client: Maybe but, mm, yeah, I wanna stop getting into trouble.
Therapist: You wanna stop getting into trouble.
Client: Yeah, but I don't think what I'm doing is that bad.
Therapist: Mm, okay.
Client: Just unlucky.
Therapist: Okay, so getting into trouble and, uh, getting caught and-and we see [unintelligible 00:05:36] does about luck and this time being unlucky.
Client: Yeah, the cops just have it out for me.
Therapist: Yes, tell me a bit more about that, Billy? Kind of give me the [unintelligible 00:05:46] the cops have got it on for you?
Client: Just 'cause growing up dealing with them and my mates and stuff and there's, you know, guilty before charged or whatever.
Therapist: Mm, so it feels like you always seemed singled out and, um, end up being unlucky.
Client: Yeah, me and my mates always get singled out.
Therapist: Okay, so you get singled out and that's what, um, means that you end up getting-- having to go to court and get sentenced and end on probation.

Examples:

Example 1
Client: But-but the wheezing is something that I've definitely noticed a little bit.
Therapist: I guess I also wonder whether, regardless of-of if your asthma symptoms are connected to Oscar, that may be part of you feels like it's worth it because he's been-

Example 2
Client: Um, I'm just- yeah I just like to have a few drinks. I mean, you know, obviously, I-I have, uh, this diagnosed condition, and-and I think, you know, if I were able to, you know, maybe take a few hits off of the joint and have a couple of beers, I think that's about the same as taking the medicine.
Therapist: Well, you know, what, I-- There are a lot of people that wouldn't disagree with you on that exactly. You know, so, um, uh, but I know that they-they were never quite sure how they were all interacting all together. Like the, um- the weed kind of tends to make people a little paranoid anyway.
Client: Yeah, I-I-I got to be careful with it. If I take more than a hit or two of it, it-it-it can be a bit of a problem.
Therapist: Yeah. Why, what happens if you take a little too much of it?
Answer: none

Example 3
Client: That's a good way to sum it up. And it's-- Well, you understand it, uh, it's just- it's not good.
Therapist: Mm. So, and then you said, you don't like how it makes you act, um, if you can tell me a little bit about that.
Answer: simple

Example 4
Client: Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know.
Therapist: But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?
Answer: complex

Example 5
Client: I wanna stay friends with them. I don't want- I don't want them to just-
Therapist: You don't wanna lose your support group, yeah. You just wanna them to support you in being healthy, while helping them, raising the babe, and so we're just taking path B. You don't wanna lose them, just maybe the lifestyle it sounds like.
Answer: none

Example 6
Client: Um, I mean, I guess- I guess I need some strategies for figuring out how to ease stress without, I guess, getting high.
Therapist: Okay. And that's a very good reason for being here. Um, can you talk to me about maybe some of your-- the goals that you have?
Answer: none

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: So, Jill, um, I know you're here to talk about your blood pressure today.
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: Um, before we get into that, I see you filled out our annual screening forms here. So if-if you're okay, can we take a minute to talk about that?
Client: Sure.
Therapist: Okay, great. It looks like, um, the way you filled out the alcohol form puts you into our, uh, third zone of drinking. Can you- can you tell me a little bit about your drinking habits, where you drink, what do you like to drink?
Client: I drink wine-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -mostly. Um, I go down to the little pub down the street.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: Have a few glasses of wine.
Therapist: Okay. Kind of socializing?
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: All right. How often do you do that?
Client: Hmm, for four times a week probably.
Therapist: Okay. And on a regular night, how much do you-- how many glasses of wine would you guess you drink?
Client: Three to four, five.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: Maybe if it's on a weekend, maybe six.
Therapist: Okay. Okay.
Client: Over a long-- over a period of time.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. Okay. So let me just show you on this, um, card here, um, from a medical perspective, we know that there's good evidence that shows that women you're age who drink more than, um, three drinks on any one occasion at any- at any sitting or more than seven in a week, are likely to run into health problems from their drinking, either problems they're having right now or maybe in the future.
Client: Are you serious?
Therapist: Yeah. Surprised, ain't you?
Client: Seven drinks in a week doesn't seem like that much?
Therapist: It sounds like you're drinking a bit more than that right now.
Client: Yeah, and I-I didn't think it was much, but that makes it look like I'm drinking way too much.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. From this, uh, drinker's pyramid over on this side of the card, you can see that the-the score on your screening sheet shows that you're up in the harmful category of drinkers. So that it's likely you're drinking, you know, in quantities probably more than about 90% of the folks who come in to see me here at the clinic.
Client: Well, I know my drinking has increased a little since I got divorced and moved to Portland, but I-I don't think it's that much of a problem.
Therapist: It doesn't feel like a problem to you right now, yeah.
Client: No, not really.
Therapist: Yeah, okay. And then the other thing I should mention, Jill, um, drinking more than these quantities, it's-it's possible it could be pushing your blood pressure up a bit, and I'm wondering if that might be affecting the difficulty we're having getting your blood pressure down right now.
Client: I didn't realize that drinking had anything to do with blood pressure.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. Yeah, it can sometimes.
Client: Oh, well. Well, then I guess that could be a problem.
Therapist: My perspective as a doctor, it would be good if you could think about cutting back a little bit or doing something different about your drinking. What-what do you think about that?
Client: I guess I can cut down some.
Therapist: Okay. So on a scale of 0 to 10, 0 being not ready at all to do that and 10 being very ready, where would you lie on that scale?
Client: I'd probably a 6.
Therapist: Okay. Okay, so that sounds-- I think that's great. So why would you be up at a six and not down at a two level? What kinds of thing would push you to be there?
Client: Well, I didn't realize that drinking was related to my blood pressure problems.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And I did fall earlier this year on my home from the bar and hurt my shoulder. I don't think the drinking made me fall, but it probably didn't help the situation.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And though my son keeps telling me that I'm drinking too much, and it's scary to think that my drinking is harmful. It's a big word.
Therapist: Yeah. Yeah. So you've got some good reasons to try to cut back a little bit.
Client: Sounds like it to me.
Therapist: Yeah. And it sounds like you're willing to maybe try not going to the bar quite as much and maybe drinking a little bit less when you go to the bar.
Client: I think I can try to do that, yeah.
Therapist: Okay. So to what levels do you think you could do that? Where-where would you wanna go with your drinking?
Client: I guess I could use those numbers, and I can't make any promises, but I could try to drink less than three in a night and less than seven in a week.
Therapist: Okay. Okay.
Client: That mean I can only drink two or three times a week.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. So you'd drink maybe just a couple of times a week and maybe a little bit less on each occasion? Is that what you're saying?
Client: Like I can try that, yeah.
Therapist: Okay. Okay.
Client: I don't think I need to quit, but I think I can try to cut down.
Therapist: And you think you're-you're able to cut down to those levels of no more than seven a week?
Client: That's what I'll shoot for.
Therapist: Okay. I think that sounds like a great step for you as your doctor. Why don't we revisit this the next time you come in to talk about your blood pressure in about six weeks or so and, um, then we can see how you're doing with it.
Client: Okay.
Therapist: All right?

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: Uh, welcome. And, uh—
Client: Thank you.
Therapist: I'd say my name is Mark and I work here at Green Prescriptions. And-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: I know a little bit about you from the referral letter from the doctor.
Client: From my GP?
Therapist: From your GP, yeah.
Client: Uh.
Therapist: But before we get to anything, I'll probably want to just ask you a little bit about what's led you to come here today and get a bit of an idea about what's been going on for you.
Client: What's led me to come here?
Therapist: Mm.
Client: My GP.
Therapist: And what did he have to say?
Client: Well, um, you know, I had my sort of, uh, checkup.
Therapist: mm.
Client: And it revealed that apparently, I might have diabetes 2. Well, that's what he says.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Um, I-I think that I feel perfectly well. I-I'm, you know-- I understand people with diabetes are a little bit plumper than I am.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: But, um, that's really why I'm here. I'm on his command, almost.
Therapist: Right, so he kinda gave you a directive?
Client: Well, he did. He says he's going to put me on some sort of program if it gets worse.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: But as I say, I-I feel absolutely fine now.
Therapist: So it kind of came a bit of a surprise, you feeling okay.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: You go for this checkup with the doctor. And he says, ""You've got Type II diabetes.""
Client: Mm, I'm very surprised.
Therapist: Mm. Came out of the blue for you?
Client: Yes. I think it did.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: And you said you kind of don't fit that kinda Type II diabetes look. That you kinda have had this idea-
Client: I-
Therapist: -you've been-been overweight with it.
Client: That's what I understand.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: You know, and I'm not overweight.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I-I sort of look after myself to a limited extent in that way. Um, but I'm a busy person, I suppose I burn off the calories. And-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I don't know, really.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: My lifestyle—
Therapist: Hmm. So it doesn't quite fit in your head, Type II diabetes and-
Client: No.
Therapist: -your lifestyle?
Client: No, not at all.
Therapist: Comes as a big surprise. And what was your reaction when he told you that at the time?
Client: Well, I-I thought he must be joking. To be honest. I thought-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -you know, why you are-- Look around you.
Therapist: Mm, mm.
Client: um, I just felt that, um-- I mean, I don't think he was wasting my time because why would he do that?
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: Right?
Therapist: He's got a lot to do.
Client: Um-- Absolutely right.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: He's got a job to do. And obviously, the tests have come through. And I have got these signs of diabetes 2.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Right? Um, I just think that-- Well, I just don't feel like it, Mark.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Um—
Therapist: So how are you feel in your head-
Client: I feel absolutely fine.
Therapist: -and what the tests say kind of like don't join up.
Client: Yeah. Well, physically, I feel absolutely fine.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I'm-I'm-- I didn't see anything wrong with me at all.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: I mean, I get around, I sleep pretty well-
Therapist: Hmm-hmm.
Client: I sort of you know-
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: - I'm-I'm compos mentis. So I don't—
Therapist: Yeah. What's the problem? Mm.
Client: What is the problem?
Therapist: And how did this happen is probably kind of what you're also thinking. Well, how did this--?
Client: Well, uh, yes. I mean-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -I must admit, I haven't done too much research. I've been a bit busy.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Um, but he-he was saying something about, I don't know, family or whatever. I don't know.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And I don't know if it's hereditary.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I think he said something about it being hereditary.
Therapist: So he mentioned, it might be a family thing. And so you-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -maybe got from your parents or something of the sort.
Client: Yeah, it could be-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -because, um, my mother mentioned-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -that, uh, my father had diabetes-
Therapist: Right.
Client: -diabetes 2. And if I think about it, um, his brother-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -uh, I haven't seen him for years.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But he might well have it because he is-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -a pretty cuddly guy. You know-
Therapist: Right.
Client: He's pretty big.
Therapist: So he fits the picture-
Client: Well, yes, the stereotype,-
Therapist: -when you think about what he-he-- Yeah, he's stereotypical.
Client: Yeah, I guess.
Therapist: A little bit bigger, perhaps doesn't look after himself that well, and he fits that foot
Client: Well, yeah. I mean, as far as I know, I hadn't seen him for-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -I don't know how many years.
Therapist: Mm. So you got this knowledge as a witness there's some family history of diabetes in the past?
Client: Apparently so. Yes, apparently so.
Therapist: Doctor mentioned that as being a factor.
Client: Mm, I mean, it is hereditary, is it?
Therapist: That's certainly true. Yes. We know that people who've had parents or have been in the past, there is a hereditary factor or genetic factor in-involved.
Client: A genetic factor. And so, does that mean that if you've got, um, if you've got a history of this within your family-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -if it's a gene-- you are more likely than not to get it?
Therapist: Correct. Yeah.
Client: Also, it's—
Therapist: But it's not inevitable.
Client: Right. Okay.
Therapist: Because its genes or the-the-the-the hereditary factor is not the only factor that causes it or is involved in it happening to you. So there's other factors that come into play.
Client: I'm sure you're going to tell me what they are.
Therapist: Well, you've-you've mentioned some of the things you know, and one of those is hereditary factors. You mentioned that the doctor mentioned that. And what else do you know or have you heard? You say you haven't had a lot of time to do the research. What else? Other things you've.
Client: To be frank, Mark, I honestly don't know. I mean, I honestly don't know what causes it because I've never had any reason. It came upon me from the GP and it took me back.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, the hereditary thing I thought, well, maybe that's the explanation.
Therapist: That makes a bit of sense.
Client: And why go any further, it's there?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Can't help it.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: They live pretty long lives, they did, all right.
Therapist: They managed with it.
Client: Relatives relatively went into their 70s.
Therapist: Okay. I don't know if it'd be helpful for you if you'd like to know a little bit more about some of the factors involved in time Type II diabetes.
Client: Well.
Therapist: If that would help.
Client: If there's something that you think that-- Yes. Yes, of course.
Therapist: Well, I'll perhaps share with you what I know from working with other people and some of the things I've experienced in working with people.
Client: Okay.
Therapist: And see what you make of it. See if it fits a little bit more with where you're at. We know that there is a strong family factor or hereditary factor, so that's one aspect. So also it tends to happen a little bit later in life, rather than something you might get when you're a teenager, this type of diabetes. So-so it's a later onset. It takes a bit of time for it to develop maybe. And the main reason I think, um, the main aspect of it is that it, have you heard about insulin.
Client: I've heard of it yeah.
Therapist: So that's a hormone or a chemical, it allows you to utilize sugar in your body.
Client: Right.
Therapist: All right. And Type II diabetes typically people have a resistance or a resistance to insulin in their cells, in their fat cells or their muscle cells or liver cells. They can't use insulin. And so sugar builds up in your system.
Client: Are you saying that they-they like they can't digest insulin or is that?
Therapist: You need insulin in your cells, individual cells in muscle or in fat or wherever to, um, use up excess sugar or to utilize sugar.
Client: Oh, I see. So-so it's like a-it's like a balance.
Therapist: That's right.
Client: So insulin you-you.
Therapist: Kind of, as your.
Client: You have yourself draws bar.
Therapist: Yap.
Client: Or something, and then what balances that out in the body is the insulin taking off the excess.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Or-or digesting? Should I say the excessive sugars?
Therapist: That's a good way to think.
Client: Is that what happened?
Therapist: Exactly. And what's happening in Type II diabetes is your-your fat cells and liver cells and muscle cells are resistant to insulin. It's almost like they're saying we can't use that.
Client: Why?
Therapist: And if-- Well, there's a number of-- We're not entirely sure, there's a lot of research still going on as to how this happens and how that could be modified. But what we do know is that, um, one of the key things in managing it is to try and modify or modulate, control the amount of sugar that are in your system.
Client: Right. Okay.
Therapist: Yeah. So there's a couple of things that we know that people with Type II diabetes have to look after and have to think about if they want to control the amount of sugar that's in their system, which is the main issue that's causing some of the health problems that people have with Type II diabetes. Too much sugar, and if it's not able to be utilized in the blood cell, in the fat cells, or liver cells, and the muscle cells stays in your bloodstream. And that can cause problems with your circulation. So too high blood sugar and too low a blood sugar can be a problem. So sugar is the main concern in Type II- Type II diabetes.And you mentioned earlier on, a couple of things that the doctor-- You've mentioned some signs that he was kind of a little bit concerned about. Well, what things did you notice over the-over the last month or so?
Client: You mean, personally?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Well, I didn't know. I mean, the thing is you see that-- I mean, I did think about this a little bit and I thought, well, over time, if things happen slowly, you don't really notice.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: As you get older.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I don't-I don't leap over five bar gates like I used to, you know, um, as opposed to, uh, running with the backs now, I tend to spend more time, you know, with my old mates in the bar.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: At the rugby club and-and-and the such like, yeah. And, um, the fish I'm hooking, I'm not after the kings anymore, I go for the snapper now, it's a bit easier, you know.
Therapist: A slightly more sedate lifestyle.
Client: Yeah, absolutely. You just do.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: You just do. Um, so you're less demanding, I guess, on your-on your body, you realize, and you don't really want to do these things anyway. You know, you let the youngsters get home.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Been there, done that. So you don't really notice. So I'm coming back to this diagnosis I had from my GP and him saying, ""You've got diabetes 2,"" well, I should feel like that, shouldn't I?
Therapist: Yeah. It should feel like there's something really wrong with you.
Client: Yeah, I mean.
Therapist: What's-how have you been feeling over the last month? So, you say you're very busy you're doing a lot of work.
Client: Yeah, I mean I'm a busy person. All right? I uh, my work uh, I work in insurance, so I'm always hopping from one place to another place.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, I haven't noticed.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: I really haven't noticed how, um, okay I get a bit--I suppose I get a bit out of breath sometimes.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: If I rush too much that-that's true. Um, I suppose, um, I don't go upstairs two at a time anymore, I use one at a time.
Therapist: So a little bit sort of energy is not quite there sometimes? The vitality.
Client: Oh, certainly the energy I have is-is not what I-what I had. I mean I do need to, you know, I'm busy but I do need to sit down, um, uh, I do need to sit down and relax with a cup of coffee, you know, and, uh, things.
Therapist: Yeah, Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, more than I would normally.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But that would be, that would be about it.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, is it getting worse? I don't know. I-I-I suppose. What worse? Is it-is it increasing? Well, to say, I don't really notice it.
Therapist: You haven't noticed it. So it's a progressive, you know, you've just seen this, as-as you got older, things have slowed down. You know those activities you used to do, but that's kind of like what happens.
Client: Yeah, yeah. Um, at least, that's what I think. I mean I don't know if you're telling me that I should be more active or my GP is saying I should be more active.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, as I say, uh, you know I-I don't do any regular form of exercise, I have to say, not anymore.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: But maybe I-maybe I don't know.
Therapist: Hmm, a bit of a mystery there.
Client: I mean I've got uh, well I-I mean I've got a great lifestyle. I mean if it's very-it-it's very good. I mean I've got all my mates in down at the rugby club. And I've got uh, you know even in the summer when that's a bit damn. I used to coach rugby and I coached cricket when I finished playing. So-so I've got the-the guys in the cricket club, um, you know, for the-for the, uh, for the summer evenings. And, uh, and then, uh, the-then, of course, we've got the fishing, and that's all of us combined. We're a big gang, really.
Therapist: Really? So what I'm hearing is there's actually a lot of aspects in your life which are really good.
Client: Oh, I think my life yeah. My life is great.
Therapist: From your perspective, things are going well?
Client: My life is great, and then you turn around and say, ""Hey you've got-- you-you're ill, you're sick.
Therapist: Yeah. It doesn't fit.
Client: And um, no I'm not. But you see, he said to me that he's gonna put me on some sort of, uh, a daily monitoring of, is it sugar levels?
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: And I'm gonna have to take regular pills.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Well frankly, the only pills I take are sort of paracetamols.
Therapist: Yeah. When you get uh, a headache.
Client: For a bit of the head in the morning, you know.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um.
Therapist: So the idea of having to test-test your blood sugar and take medications is kinda like off--
Client: Come on, you know.
Therapist: And you know that's a bit too-
Client: Well, life is too short.
Therapist: Too much.
Client: You know it's the truth.
Therapist: Yeah. Okay.
Client: I mean you know—
Therapist: And you're here today and that's probably something in you you've thought well I'll follow this through, you know I'll-I'll come along and see what-see what they've got to say. And I'm just wondering for this session, for the time we have today, there's a number of things we could talk about. You mentioned a couple of things about your lifestyle and, um, medication is one thing you've been told by the doctor you might need to do that. And a number of things that we could talk about today. Which-which area would you think would be useful for you to focus on?
Client: Well there is-there is something that you sort of prompted me to think about, and, um, I split up-- My wife and I, we split up several years ago now. And, um, you know we've been married for many many years.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: And um, I think she used to look after me because she used to do the cooking and-and-and stuff like that.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And I have to say that I'm not the best cook in the world.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, and-and being on the run all the time and you know once I get back home, it's, you know, it's time to go down to the rugby club or whatever it might be, uh, we're out with the mates. And, uh, I-I do I suppose my food is not as healthy perhaps as it used to be when she was around. She's moved down to Hamilton to live with her mother, if you've met her mother. Anyway, but, um.
Therapist: So then, since you've been on your own since you've separated, divorced and you've noticed that the things you eat and how you eat has changed.
Client: Yeah, I mean mates and their wives are pretty cool about it sometimes.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Because, you know, they'll invite me for dinner and so on.
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: And, yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess, you know, that's when you, well, or whatever reason, you split up in life.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You start looking at the home life of somebody else, you're thinking, ""Hmm, I use d to have this.""
Therapist: Hmm. Yeah, yeah.
Client: And you think, "" This is nice food, "" isn't it? and you know.
Therapist: Yeah. And your-- part of your wife used to do a lot of that for you?
Client: Oh, she would do all the cooking. Yeah, yeah,
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I never bothered to boil an egg in the water, you know.
Therapist: And so she would kinda look after what you ate and healthy things that you had, spread in front of you and off you go.
Client: Totally. I mean, I was just in charge of the wine, you know.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. And now you have to think about what you might eat and sometimes you don't eat the best.
Client: Well I-- This is what I'm saying. Maybe I'm not thinking about it. Maybe that's the thing.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Maybe I'm just—
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You know, because it-- you know this-- the pizza shop's just on the road.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And then there's-- I mean, okay, I confess that lunchtime, occasionally, it's uh, I'm hungry and McDonald's is very convenient
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -or Kentucky Fried or whatever.
Therapist: Very appealing, isn't it?
Client: You know, it's very easy. and then, um, then you think to yourself, well-- I mean, I do think of myself that maybe I should have a few vegetables around here or whatever. But then you go out into the supermarkets, you know, and you can pick up, uh, your- one of your TV dinners.
Therapist: Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm.
Client: So you bring those in and you open them up and put them in the microwave and there's vegetables there.
Therapist: Yeah they look pretty good on the plate, don't they?
Client: Yeah, it looks- it looks fine, you know, et cetera. I mean, so that will happen occasionally if I've got a night in. But cooking-wise, no, I haven't cooked anything, um, other than boil the water for the kettle for a cup o coffee.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -for ages.
Therapist: They're food choices in what you eat and what's in your diet it's not what-something you actually you've actually been aware of or had to think about in the past.
Client: Yeah. I do miss her breakfast. I have to say, we used to have get a nice breakfast.
Therapist: So one thing that you noticed is diet and the eating patterns and-
Client: Well—
Therapist: -when you eat. That's one aspect. What other aspects do you think you've-- you would be--?
Client: Well, I used to be quite a heavy smoker, right? I mean, I'd smoke a pack in a half a day. And I knew that wasn't doing me any good.
Therapist: Right.
Client: I mean the thing is when you're a-- I mean, I've always smoked. So, but when you're young and you're a sportsman, you know—
Therapist: You kinda juggle those two things and kinda--
Client: Well, the two things they balance out, you know and everybody else is
Therapist: You still run and have a cigarette?
Client: You know, you pass a cigarette down the backline almost, don't you? You know, just before the game gets—
Therapist: Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, part of the culture.
Client: Yeah, part of the of the whole thing. And it's changed a bit now, because in my day when we were playing, of course, it was a very much more of a social game, which was spent-spent in the rugby club.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: That's why you played and it was a big buddy-buddy thing.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: That was rugby and cricket was the same really.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Um, but now—
Therapist: But over the years, you've actually reduced your smoking or you've stopped altogether or at times?
Client: Well I-I, yeah. I was getting a bit sort of-- I was getting a bit, you know, a bit wheezy and I thought, ""I'll cut this out.""
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: But I enjoy smoking. I really do enjoy it. So I cut it down to I suppose it's about 10 a day now.
Therapist: Okay, so you meant to reduce.
Client: Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: You were noticing that it's having an impact on your breathing and health wasn't so good.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: When you related that to your smoking, so you managed to reduce your smoking.
Client: Yeah, yeah. I sort of—
Therapist: So you've made our decision to do that?
Client: it-it-it's-- you know, she will, ""Why don't you give up? You've gone so far, why don't you just stop?"" But I don't want to.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: It's-it's-- I-I enjoy it, um—
Therapist: Yeah, and it's hard to get to stop something you enjoy, isn't it?
Client: Well, yeah. I mean, you know, the thing is that you get to, you know, you've got to-- when you get down to that, you, uh, you have to regulate sort of-
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You know, you have to be quite strong-willed about, I suppose, in a way.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: So you say, ""Okay, well, you don't have a cigarette unless you have a cup of coffee. [laughs]
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know.
Therapist: But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?
Client: Oh, yeah, yeah. I have two sugars. A couple of sugar in coffee. Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: So we cut that down as I say.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: But the problem goes that coffee, we're up to 8 or so, 10 cups of coffee a day now.
Therapist: You're drinking more coffee. So what I've heard you say so far is, if I can just start right back from the beginning and you used to come in and sais, ""I went to the doctor."" You went for-- it sounds like you went for just a checkup.
Client: No, you know, there's a friend of mine, one of the guys down the rugby club, he said- he said, ""I'm going for my annual, you know-
Therapist: MIT.
Client: -warranty of fitness, sort of thing, you know. And I thought, now that's an idea, not been to one of those.
Therapist: Got to check out, why not?
Client: So I'm 55, and you read in the papers, you know, it's that at 55 you will-- you know, heart disease is more prevalent
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: -and all these sorts of things that you get around this middle-age time. So I thought, ""Well, I'll go and have one."" And frankly, when I went along, I was very confident. I thought, you know, the doctor is going to saying, ""Hmm, I wish I was as healthy as you,"" sort of thing.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, but unfortunately, uh, he-he came up with this. And it's the only thing I think he really came up with. I think-
Therapist: So everything else looked pretty good?
Client: My cholesterol is quite good, not too bad.
Therapist: Cholesterol good, your weight is good.
Client: Yeah-yeah. Not too bad.
Therapist: Um, you are smoking, but you've managed to reduce that.
Client: Well, yeah, I've cut it down, yeah. I mean, that's been three years, mind.
Therapist: And anything else, you know, you go ticking down the list. The tire is good, oil good.
Client: Absolutely.
Therapist: So we're looking good.
Client: And then we come to this-
Therapist: And ah, hang on.
Client: -too much sugar in the tank, or something. I don't know.
Therapist: Yeah, there's something wrong with the, uh, with this bit.
Client: So, yeah.
Therapist: And it doesn't quite fit with how you see your own lifestyle.
Client: No.
Therapist: Because you've-- it sounds like what you've been doing, you've made some conscious effort to be aware of some of those things you might think are important.
Client: I mean, yeah. I mean, you know, the thing is, you see, the thing is, and I mean, and probably you've-- I think you've heard this before, but people, they turn around, oh, uh, you know, doom and gloom prophets, you shouldn't drink.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: You shouldn't smoke.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And then I think to myself, ""Well, maybe I shouldn't socialize."" And then after that, ""Well, maybe I shouldn't be alive.""
Therapist: So like a domino effect, and they'll all be just sitting-
Client: You know. I mean, what-what-what's going on here? This is- this is- this is so many people's lives.
Therapist: Mm-hm.
Client: And um, I suppose, you know, if it came down to it, then, and somebody said, ""Well, you can solve this problem by taking a pill once a day, um, you know, it will keep it down, and there will be no problems,"" Then I-I could go with that. But what I don't want to do, um, the doctor was saying, or insinuating, that I'd have to change my lifestyle.
Therapist: A bit broad kind of like you've gotta change everything.
Client: Yeah. It was um, and I-I said, well, no. I'm sorry. [coughs] I'm not going to change my lifestyle. I've got to where I am. I'm reasonably happy. Okay, I wish I wasn't separated. Okay, I wish my kids were-were still around, um, you know. One of them is off now in, um, in-- back in Europe playing rugby in France.
Therapist: Yeah. And your thought was, yeah, right, I hear that, but actually, I don't want to make all these big changes in my life.
Client: No, I don't want to, because I don't feel that I need to.
Therapist: Feel like you need to. Yeah.
Client: I mean, it's you know, why?
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Um, I can't argue with a medical professional, Mark, because I know nothing, you know.
Therapist: The test, is the test, and experience, yeah.
Client: So, I mean, what-what-what-what suggestions would you have? I mean, what-what sort of-
Therapist: I don't know. I think it's up to you where we start, and that's the question I've got in my mind. You've mentioned a couple of things that you've already made some effort, or been conscious of. You've mentioned the diet, you've mentioned your smoking, those are two quite important aspects that we often talk about here in how people work.
Client: Is smoking related to diabetes then?
Therapist: It can have an impact, yes. So smoking, um, affects your blood system, so it hardens the arteries, um, and over time, it can have a significant impact on the healing of wounds. So people with Type II diabetes, often, if they get a cut, or a bruise, or something, it takes a long time to heal. Smoking reduces the amount of oxygen in your system, so that can further, you know, limit the time it takes your body to heal.
Client: Oh.
Therapist: So we know that smoking and Type II diabetes together-
Client: Don't help.
Therapist: -isn't a good combination.
Client: Is it okay if you have one without the other? I'm sorry, it's a silly question. [laughs]
Therapist: Well, the question is, I suppose, that I have for you is, where would you think, for you, would be a good place to start? If you were gonna make any changes, even small changes at the beginning, rather than just thinking, oh, I got to change everything, which it sounds like you're not prepared to, you know, do a whole lifestyle change, and I don't think that's what we're talking about here. Where would you feel most comfortable to start if you were gonna make any changes at all?
Client: Where would I start? Well, I-- What if about if I cut down on sugar in the coffee? If we could have long blacks, no milk, and no sugar.
Therapist: Yeah. Hmm, that might be a start.
Client: I think I could- I think I could probably handle that.
Therapist: Hm. What we also find is that people make these little changes, small changes, and that starts to kind of well, it makes them-
Client: Something of a rollover effect.
Therapist: -rollover, the domino effect starts to happen, and they start looking at other aspects.
Client: Domino effect, yeah.
Therapist: So rather than thinking, ""oh, my God, I have to change all these things. I've gotta stop smoking, I've gotta exercise more, I've gotta, you know, start eating more fruit and vegetables,"" you might start with these small changes, and then-
Client: I mean, how much exercise should I do a week?
Therapist: Um, I-I'm reluctant to give a prescription for that because I think it's really up to you. And I think it depends on how things go, as to how much you need to do.
Client: Right.
Therapist: You mentioned earlier on, the doctors talking about you monitoring your blood sugar.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So on how-- It depends on how-how that goes. Let's say, if you started doing that and you do some more exercise, you start to have longer blacks, rather than short blacks with lots of sugar. And you get down the sugar and you find your blood sugar starts to come down, then we're heading in the right direction.
Client: Okay, so—
Therapist: So it's really, I suppose, up to how things go for you, and you get that feedback. And if that's going in the right direction, you carry on doing and do some more of that.
Client: So, a-are we saying then that-that, really all I need to do, for this moment, is I can forget about everything, but cut out the sugar, uh, in the coffee and the milk-- I don't know, but you might as well, you know, milk without sugar is silly. But, um, if we do that, is that where we start?
Therapist: I think where we start is where you feel comfortable starting.
Client: Well, I mean that's something that's not difficult to do.
Therapist: Apples for breakfast.
Client: You start off at breakfast and get yourself an apple, a bit-a bit of apple and-and so on. Um—
Therapist: So what I'm hearing you're kind of saying is, that there's-- You're now starting to think of some very useful little starting points.
Client: Maybe.
Therapist: Not huge changes, but some little things you could do.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And it's kind of dawning on you there may be some possibilities here for making some changes. Let me ask you this. Um, let's say you put some of these things in place and you start to make some of these small changes.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Um, where do you see that taking you in the next set of three, four, five years? You know, where do you want to be in three to four years' time? What would be your ideal picture?
Client: Well, you know, and this is difficult because I don't feel unhealthy now.
Therapist: No.
Client: So, I suppose it would be fun to-- Maybe I should join a club or two, that's what I'm thinking because I'll be with mates.
Therapist: Yeah? You like the social aspect?
Client: I love the social aspect of it, and, um, there's-there's-- I know there's a bar in this club as well. I-- Don't-don't misunderstand me, I don't drink-
Therapist: No, no, I get that. I get that.
Client: -till-- You know, I'm not an alcoholic or anything like that, I—
Therapist: So part of that whole keeping fit and exercise stuff is actually the social side of it, isn't it?
Client: So yeah, so to get that balance, and maybe that's what I'm actually missing in life, and maybe this is, um-- I mean yes I do get up in the morning sometimes, and I suppose I do feel a bit—
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: You know? Even after a decent night's sleep, you know?
Therapist: Haven't quite that-
Client: And you need-- I'm getting this cup of coffee and maybe I'm—
Therapist: And the coffee helps a little bit because it perks you up?
Client: And that gets me going. Yeah.
Therapist: And the sugar in it helps too.
Client: Yeah, the sugar gives me the boost, I suppose. I-it's fantastic.
Therapist: So what I'm hearing is that your life, your work, your routines are-- Sometimes you're driving or you've got to keep awake, get up in the morning sometimes and you haven't quite got that buzz or the energy. You need a shot, and then throughout the day you might need just more shots to keep that energy up.
Client: Hmm. If I give up sugar in my coffee, give up the milk, black coffees, right?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: if I find some social form of exercise, like squash.
Therapist: And an activity which has got a starting to finish and it's something you do for a slot.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And then there's maybe some social aspects to it as well.
Client: Yeah, and then—
Therapist: You can see some benefits and some enjoyment that.
Client: And then, you know, give this, say, six months, I don't know what period it would be, then go back to the GP and say, ""Test me again.""
Therapist: That sounds like a great plan.
Client: And so maybe that would, uh—
Therapist: Yeah, sounds like a good idea.
Client: Maybe it's an idea. I mean—
Therapist: I think anything you do, it has to be something you've decided. You know, just start where you want to start. You've mentioned some really good ideas about possibly getting a little bit more exercise into your life, doing something like squash or something of that nature. You've mentioned some really good ideas about reducing the amount of sugar you-you-you're-you're intaking during the day, and coffee is a good place to start. Having an apple for breakfast, I think you mentioned that, a bit of fruit.
Client: Yeah, like my wife used to. Yeah.
Therapist: Those are some really good ideas and good starting points. So thinking about it like that, what-- Where are you now? What's your-- What-what-- Where-where is your thinking now?
Client: Well, you see, I mean, I'm thinking, ""Actually it might not be a bad idea this,"" because [chuckles] it would mean I could socialize harder, couldn't I? No, no I'm just joking. Uh, but, um, yeah, I mean, why not? Why not? Why not? It might be fun, it's a new path.
Therapist: What's to lose? What's to gain?
Client: Well, it would appear that there is something to gain, and-- I mean, I-- What do I lose? I don't know until I do it. But I'm thinking that if I do it and I do what I'm enjoying doing, I won't miss what I'm not doing. Does that make sense?
Therapist: It does make sense, yeah.
Client: Um, yeah I don't mind. I-- It's not a—
Therapist: So when you look at it, there's probably more to gain from making these changes than there is to lose.
Client: I'll talk to Billy about, um-- Billy is, um, he's the gym bloke.
Therapist: Right.
Client: I'll have a word with him because I'm due down the club tonight.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Really.
Therapist: So you've got to work these things on your mind. You know, the-- And workout where's the place to start.
Client: Yeah, I think that you say where-where you're at now, where you're going, where—
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -and-and-and this is what I've got to do. I think I'm in a rut. I think that's where I've—
Therapist: You've been stuck?
Client: I'm-I'm just-- I'm-I'm satisfiedly sort of contented, uh, sitting in this- in this rut and, um, that my doctor has actually di-diagnosed me with diabetes 2-
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: -which he says can be managed, and you seem to be insinuating that it can be managed.
Therapist: Indeed, yeah.
Client: Uh, maybe this is a blessing, actually-
Therapist: So rather than--
Client: -because I think to myself, ""Well, if someday, I am diagnosed with diabetes, I'd just carry on and-""
Therapist: Carrying on.
Client: ""-sitting in the corner of the bar, and chat, and talk and probably get fat."" I don't know, and make it worse. And, yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.
Therapist: So it's been a bit of a-a bit of a shock, but now you kinda reflect on it.
Client: Yeah, that's cool.
Therapist: Maybe this is the-
Client: That's really cool.
Therapist: -bit of a shake that I needed, you know, just sort of remind me. I might feel okay. I might-- From my perspective, your perspective, you're thinking, ""Well, what's the problem? Everything's fine.""
Client: Mm.
Therapist: But now you seem to be thinking looking and thinking, ""Maybe things weren't, or aren't, as good as I thought they were.""
Client: Yeah, I mean, I think you're quite right. I think you just—
Therapist: Things could be better?
Client: I don't know, you become sedentary, don't you? No, it seems that-- No, actually, this is quite exciting. It quite [unintelligible 00:31:28]
Therapist: Yeah, I sense that. I sense that in you that you're--
Client: I think to myself, I think, ""Oh,"" I think go—
Therapist: Quite invigorated with the idea of--
Client: Yeah. I mean, this is- this is- this is cool, it's like an old challenge again.
Therapist: Making some of these changes. Yeah.
Client: This is good. And, um—
Therapist: You're up for the challenge?
Client: I think I am. I mean, I never thought about it, but when I think about it now it's, ""What am I doing here?"" Why am I like this? Why am I just happy contented to drift?
Therapist: So think about when you were-- This-this is an interesting question to see what you think. You were- you were a coach. You-- Maybe you'll be a coach again.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: What would you say if you were talking to yourself, if you like, you know, if you were the coach saying, ""Right--""
Client: Oh, so if I was obs- if I was sort of-
Therapist: Yeah, what-what would you be saying?
Client: -observing as it were?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Watching myself, what would I say? I-I-- Well, I would say, you know, are you happy?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: That-- Are you contented with that performance of you and your team?
Therapist: And, I suppose, our own personalized a little bit like that, there's lots of different aspects that need to be tweaked.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Modified and looked at, to get the best out of ourselves, to get the best out of the opportunities we have.
Client: I think you're- I think you're right. I think, um-- And again, you put them together and it's-it's-it's becoming-- It's-it's a sort of a-an individual team job, isn't it really?
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: That, okay, do a bit of this and do a bit of that.
Therapist: Some good things I'm- some things I'm good at and there are some other aspects we think, ""Well--""
Client: Yeah, but I don't have to give up anything really, do I?
Therapist: It's not about giving up your personality or-
Client: No.
Therapist: -changing who you are fundamentally.
Client: No it's not. It's not.
Therapist: It's just tweaking things. Just fine-tuning a few areas and being a bit more aw-aware of one aspect of your life a bit more, like the food choices or whatever. Well, Mike, I-I've really enjoyed listening to your perspective, and your story a little bit, and it's helped me a lot to get an idea about where you're coming from, and a little bit about who you are, and what's happened in your past. And-and we've also talked a bit about what's going to happen next. And you've come up with some great ideas. What I hear you saying is that, you know, before all this, before you met the GP, things are going fine.Well, as you would of-- As, you know, as you'd seen it, you were just doing your thing, and getting on working, and being busy, and being successful, and then suddenly this diagnosis, this doctor tells you that you've got a problem.

Examples:

Example 1
Client: But-but the wheezing is something that I've definitely noticed a little bit.
Therapist: I guess I also wonder whether, regardless of-of if your asthma symptoms are connected to Oscar, that may be part of you feels like it's worth it because he's been-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: -such a big part of your life for so long.
Answer: complex

Example 2
Client: Um, I'm just- yeah I just like to have a few drinks. I mean, you know, obviously, I-I have, uh, this diagnosed condition, and-and I think, you know, if I were able to, you know, maybe take a few hits off of the joint and have a couple of beers, I think that's about the same as taking the medicine.
Therapist: Well, you know, what, I-- There are a lot of people that wouldn't disagree with you on that exactly. You know, so, um, uh, but I know that they-they were never quite sure how they were all interacting all together. Like the, um- the weed kind of tends to make people a little paranoid anyway.
Client: Yeah, I-I-I got to be careful with it. If I take more than a hit or two of it, it-it-it can be a bit of a problem.
Therapist: Yeah. Why, what happens if you take a little too much of it?
Answer: none

Example 3
Client: That's a good way to sum it up. And it's-- Well, you understand it, uh, it's just- it's not good.
Therapist: Mm. So, and then you said, you don't like how it makes you act, um, if you can tell me a little bit about that.
Answer: simple

Example 4
Client: Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know.
Therapist: But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?
Answer: complex

Example 5
Client: I wanna stay friends with them. I don't want- I don't want them to just-
Therapist: You don't wanna lose your support group, yeah. You just wanna them to support you in being healthy, while helping them, raising the babe, and so we're just taking path B. You don't wanna lose them, just maybe the lifestyle it sounds like.
Answer: none

Example 6
Client: Um, I mean, I guess- I guess I need some strategies for figuring out how to ease stress without, I guess, getting high.
Therapist: Okay. And that's a very good reason for being here. Um, can you talk to me about maybe some of your-- the goals that you have?
Answer: none

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: Uh, welcome. And, uh—
Client: Thank you.
Therapist: I'd say my name is Mark and I work here at Green Prescriptions. And-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: I know a little bit about you from the referral letter from the doctor.
Client: From my GP?
Therapist: From your GP, yeah.
Client: Uh.
Therapist: But before we get to anything, I'll probably want to just ask you a little bit about what's led you to come here today and get a bit of an idea about what's been going on for you.
Client: What's led me to come here?
Therapist: Mm.
Client: My GP.
Therapist: And what did he have to say?
Client: Well, um, you know, I had my sort of, uh, checkup.
Therapist: mm.
Client: And it revealed that apparently, I might have diabetes 2. Well, that's what he says.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Um, I-I think that I feel perfectly well. I-I'm, you know-- I understand people with diabetes are a little bit plumper than I am.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: But, um, that's really why I'm here. I'm on his command, almost.
Therapist: Right, so he kinda gave you a directive?
Client: Well, he did. He says he's going to put me on some sort of program if it gets worse.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: But as I say, I-I feel absolutely fine now.
Therapist: So it kind of came a bit of a surprise, you feeling okay.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: You go for this checkup with the doctor. And he says, ""You've got Type II diabetes.""
Client: Mm, I'm very surprised.
Therapist: Mm. Came out of the blue for you?
Client: Yes. I think it did.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: And you said you kind of don't fit that kinda Type II diabetes look. That you kinda have had this idea-
Client: I-
Therapist: -you've been-been overweight with it.
Client: That's what I understand.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: You know, and I'm not overweight.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I-I sort of look after myself to a limited extent in that way. Um, but I'm a busy person, I suppose I burn off the calories. And-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I don't know, really.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: My lifestyle—
Therapist: Hmm. So it doesn't quite fit in your head, Type II diabetes and-
Client: No.
Therapist: -your lifestyle?
Client: No, not at all.
Therapist: Comes as a big surprise. And what was your reaction when he told you that at the time?
Client: Well, I-I thought he must be joking. To be honest. I thought-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -you know, why you are-- Look around you.
Therapist: Mm, mm.
Client: um, I just felt that, um-- I mean, I don't think he was wasting my time because why would he do that?
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: Right?
Therapist: He's got a lot to do.
Client: Um-- Absolutely right.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: He's got a job to do. And obviously, the tests have come through. And I have got these signs of diabetes 2.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Right? Um, I just think that-- Well, I just don't feel like it, Mark.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Um—
Therapist: So how are you feel in your head-
Client: I feel absolutely fine.
Therapist: -and what the tests say kind of like don't join up.
Client: Yeah. Well, physically, I feel absolutely fine.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I'm-I'm-- I didn't see anything wrong with me at all.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: I mean, I get around, I sleep pretty well-
Therapist: Hmm-hmm.
Client: I sort of you know-
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: - I'm-I'm compos mentis. So I don't—
Therapist: Yeah. What's the problem? Mm.
Client: What is the problem?
Therapist: And how did this happen is probably kind of what you're also thinking. Well, how did this--?
Client: Well, uh, yes. I mean-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -I must admit, I haven't done too much research. I've been a bit busy.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Um, but he-he was saying something about, I don't know, family or whatever. I don't know.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And I don't know if it's hereditary.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I think he said something about it being hereditary.
Therapist: So he mentioned, it might be a family thing. And so you-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -maybe got from your parents or something of the sort.
Client: Yeah, it could be-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -because, um, my mother mentioned-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -that, uh, my father had diabetes-
Therapist: Right.
Client: -diabetes 2. And if I think about it, um, his brother-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -uh, I haven't seen him for years.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But he might well have it because he is-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -a pretty cuddly guy. You know-
Therapist: Right.
Client: He's pretty big.
Therapist: So he fits the picture-
Client: Well, yes, the stereotype,-
Therapist: -when you think about what he-he-- Yeah, he's stereotypical.
Client: Yeah, I guess.
Therapist: A little bit bigger, perhaps doesn't look after himself that well, and he fits that foot
Client: Well, yeah. I mean, as far as I know, I hadn't seen him for-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -I don't know how many years.
Therapist: Mm. So you got this knowledge as a witness there's some family history of diabetes in the past?
Client: Apparently so. Yes, apparently so.
Therapist: Doctor mentioned that as being a factor.
Client: Mm, I mean, it is hereditary, is it?
Therapist: That's certainly true. Yes. We know that people who've had parents or have been in the past, there is a hereditary factor or genetic factor in-involved.
Client: A genetic factor. And so, does that mean that if you've got, um, if you've got a history of this within your family-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -if it's a gene-- you are more likely than not to get it?
Therapist: Correct. Yeah.
Client: Also, it's—
Therapist: But it's not inevitable.
Client: Right. Okay.
Therapist: Because its genes or the-the-the-the hereditary factor is not the only factor that causes it or is involved in it happening to you. So there's other factors that come into play.
Client: I'm sure you're going to tell me what they are.
Therapist: Well, you've-you've mentioned some of the things you know, and one of those is hereditary factors. You mentioned that the doctor mentioned that. And what else do you know or have you heard? You say you haven't had a lot of time to do the research. What else? Other things you've.
Client: To be frank, Mark, I honestly don't know. I mean, I honestly don't know what causes it because I've never had any reason. It came upon me from the GP and it took me back.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, the hereditary thing I thought, well, maybe that's the explanation.
Therapist: That makes a bit of sense.
Client: And why go any further, it's there?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Can't help it.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: They live pretty long lives, they did, all right.
Therapist: They managed with it.
Client: Relatives relatively went into their 70s.
Therapist: Okay. I don't know if it'd be helpful for you if you'd like to know a little bit more about some of the factors involved in time Type II diabetes.
Client: Well.
Therapist: If that would help.
Client: If there's something that you think that-- Yes. Yes, of course.
Therapist: Well, I'll perhaps share with you what I know from working with other people and some of the things I've experienced in working with people.
Client: Okay.
Therapist: And see what you make of it. See if it fits a little bit more with where you're at. We know that there is a strong family factor or hereditary factor, so that's one aspect. So also it tends to happen a little bit later in life, rather than something you might get when you're a teenager, this type of diabetes. So-so it's a later onset. It takes a bit of time for it to develop maybe. And the main reason I think, um, the main aspect of it is that it, have you heard about insulin.
Client: I've heard of it yeah.
Therapist: So that's a hormone or a chemical, it allows you to utilize sugar in your body.
Client: Right.
Therapist: All right. And Type II diabetes typically people have a resistance or a resistance to insulin in their cells, in their fat cells or their muscle cells or liver cells. They can't use insulin. And so sugar builds up in your system.
Client: Are you saying that they-they like they can't digest insulin or is that?
Therapist: You need insulin in your cells, individual cells in muscle or in fat or wherever to, um, use up excess sugar or to utilize sugar.
Client: Oh, I see. So-so it's like a-it's like a balance.
Therapist: That's right.
Client: So insulin you-you.
Therapist: Kind of, as your.
Client: You have yourself draws bar.
Therapist: Yap.
Client: Or something, and then what balances that out in the body is the insulin taking off the excess.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Or-or digesting? Should I say the excessive sugars?
Therapist: That's a good way to think.
Client: Is that what happened?
Therapist: Exactly. And what's happening in Type II diabetes is your-your fat cells and liver cells and muscle cells are resistant to insulin. It's almost like they're saying we can't use that.
Client: Why?
Therapist: And if-- Well, there's a number of-- We're not entirely sure, there's a lot of research still going on as to how this happens and how that could be modified. But what we do know is that, um, one of the key things in managing it is to try and modify or modulate, control the amount of sugar that are in your system.
Client: Right. Okay.
Therapist: Yeah. So there's a couple of things that we know that people with Type II diabetes have to look after and have to think about if they want to control the amount of sugar that's in their system, which is the main issue that's causing some of the health problems that people have with Type II diabetes. Too much sugar, and if it's not able to be utilized in the blood cell, in the fat cells, or liver cells, and the muscle cells stays in your bloodstream. And that can cause problems with your circulation. So too high blood sugar and too low a blood sugar can be a problem. So sugar is the main concern in Type II- Type II diabetes.And you mentioned earlier on, a couple of things that the doctor-- You've mentioned some signs that he was kind of a little bit concerned about. Well, what things did you notice over the-over the last month or so?
Client: You mean, personally?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Well, I didn't know. I mean, the thing is you see that-- I mean, I did think about this a little bit and I thought, well, over time, if things happen slowly, you don't really notice.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: As you get older.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I don't-I don't leap over five bar gates like I used to, you know, um, as opposed to, uh, running with the backs now, I tend to spend more time, you know, with my old mates in the bar.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: At the rugby club and-and-and the such like, yeah. And, um, the fish I'm hooking, I'm not after the kings anymore, I go for the snapper now, it's a bit easier, you know.
Therapist: A slightly more sedate lifestyle.
Client: Yeah, absolutely. You just do.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: You just do. Um, so you're less demanding, I guess, on your-on your body, you realize, and you don't really want to do these things anyway. You know, you let the youngsters get home.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Been there, done that. So you don't really notice. So I'm coming back to this diagnosis I had from my GP and him saying, ""You've got diabetes 2,"" well, I should feel like that, shouldn't I?
Therapist: Yeah. It should feel like there's something really wrong with you.
Client: Yeah, I mean.
Therapist: What's-how have you been feeling over the last month? So, you say you're very busy you're doing a lot of work.
Client: Yeah, I mean I'm a busy person. All right? I uh, my work uh, I work in insurance, so I'm always hopping from one place to another place.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, I haven't noticed.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: I really haven't noticed how, um, okay I get a bit--I suppose I get a bit out of breath sometimes.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: If I rush too much that-that's true. Um, I suppose, um, I don't go upstairs two at a time anymore, I use one at a time.
Therapist: So a little bit sort of energy is not quite there sometimes? The vitality.
Client: Oh, certainly the energy I have is-is not what I-what I had. I mean I do need to, you know, I'm busy but I do need to sit down, um, uh, I do need to sit down and relax with a cup of coffee, you know, and, uh, things.
Therapist: Yeah, Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, more than I would normally.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But that would be, that would be about it.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, is it getting worse? I don't know. I-I-I suppose. What worse? Is it-is it increasing? Well, to say, I don't really notice it.
Therapist: You haven't noticed it. So it's a progressive, you know, you've just seen this, as-as you got older, things have slowed down. You know those activities you used to do, but that's kind of like what happens.
Client: Yeah, yeah. Um, at least, that's what I think. I mean I don't know if you're telling me that I should be more active or my GP is saying I should be more active.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, as I say, uh, you know I-I don't do any regular form of exercise, I have to say, not anymore.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: But maybe I-maybe I don't know.
Therapist: Hmm, a bit of a mystery there.
Client: I mean I've got uh, well I-I mean I've got a great lifestyle. I mean if it's very-it-it's very good. I mean I've got all my mates in down at the rugby club. And I've got uh, you know even in the summer when that's a bit damn. I used to coach rugby and I coached cricket when I finished playing. So-so I've got the-the guys in the cricket club, um, you know, for the-for the, uh, for the summer evenings. And, uh, and then, uh, the-then, of course, we've got the fishing, and that's all of us combined. We're a big gang, really.
Therapist: Really? So what I'm hearing is there's actually a lot of aspects in your life which are really good.
Client: Oh, I think my life yeah. My life is great.
Therapist: From your perspective, things are going well?
Client: My life is great, and then you turn around and say, ""Hey you've got-- you-you're ill, you're sick.
Therapist: Yeah. It doesn't fit.
Client: And um, no I'm not. But you see, he said to me that he's gonna put me on some sort of, uh, a daily monitoring of, is it sugar levels?
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: And I'm gonna have to take regular pills.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Well frankly, the only pills I take are sort of paracetamols.
Therapist: Yeah. When you get uh, a headache.
Client: For a bit of the head in the morning, you know.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um.
Therapist: So the idea of having to test-test your blood sugar and take medications is kinda like off--
Client: Come on, you know.
Therapist: And you know that's a bit too-
Client: Well, life is too short.
Therapist: Too much.
Client: You know it's the truth.
Therapist: Yeah. Okay.
Client: I mean you know—
Therapist: And you're here today and that's probably something in you you've thought well I'll follow this through, you know I'll-I'll come along and see what-see what they've got to say. And I'm just wondering for this session, for the time we have today, there's a number of things we could talk about. You mentioned a couple of things about your lifestyle and, um, medication is one thing you've been told by the doctor you might need to do that. And a number of things that we could talk about today. Which-which area would you think would be useful for you to focus on?
Client: Well there is-there is something that you sort of prompted me to think about, and, um, I split up-- My wife and I, we split up several years ago now. And, um, you know we've been married for many many years.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: And um, I think she used to look after me because she used to do the cooking and-and-and stuff like that.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And I have to say that I'm not the best cook in the world.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, and-and being on the run all the time and you know once I get back home, it's, you know, it's time to go down to the rugby club or whatever it might be, uh, we're out with the mates. And, uh, I-I do I suppose my food is not as healthy perhaps as it used to be when she was around. She's moved down to Hamilton to live with her mother, if you've met her mother. Anyway, but, um.
Therapist: So then, since you've been on your own since you've separated, divorced and you've noticed that the things you eat and how you eat has changed.
Client: Yeah, I mean mates and their wives are pretty cool about it sometimes.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Because, you know, they'll invite me for dinner and so on.
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: And, yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess, you know, that's when you, well, or whatever reason, you split up in life.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You start looking at the home life of somebody else, you're thinking, ""Hmm, I use d to have this.""
Therapist: Hmm. Yeah, yeah.
Client: And you think, "" This is nice food, "" isn't it? and you know.
Therapist: Yeah. And your-- part of your wife used to do a lot of that for you?
Client: Oh, she would do all the cooking. Yeah, yeah,
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I never bothered to boil an egg in the water, you know.
Therapist: And so she would kinda look after what you ate and healthy things that you had, spread in front of you and off you go.
Client: Totally. I mean, I was just in charge of the wine, you know.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. And now you have to think about what you might eat and sometimes you don't eat the best.
Client: Well I-- This is what I'm saying. Maybe I'm not thinking about it. Maybe that's the thing.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Maybe I'm just—
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You know, because it-- you know this-- the pizza shop's just on the road.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And then there's-- I mean, okay, I confess that lunchtime, occasionally, it's uh, I'm hungry and McDonald's is very convenient
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -or Kentucky Fried or whatever.
Therapist: Very appealing, isn't it?
Client: You know, it's very easy. and then, um, then you think to yourself, well-- I mean, I do think of myself that maybe I should have a few vegetables around here or whatever. But then you go out into the supermarkets, you know, and you can pick up, uh, your- one of your TV dinners.
Therapist: Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm.
Client: So you bring those in and you open them up and put them in the microwave and there's vegetables there.
Therapist: Yeah they look pretty good on the plate, don't they?
Client: Yeah, it looks- it looks fine, you know, et cetera. I mean, so that will happen occasionally if I've got a night in. But cooking-wise, no, I haven't cooked anything, um, other than boil the water for the kettle for a cup o coffee.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -for ages.
Therapist: They're food choices in what you eat and what's in your diet it's not what-something you actually you've actually been aware of or had to think about in the past.
Client: Yeah. I do miss her breakfast. I have to say, we used to have get a nice breakfast.
Therapist: So one thing that you noticed is diet and the eating patterns and-
Client: Well—
Therapist: -when you eat. That's one aspect. What other aspects do you think you've-- you would be--?
Client: Well, I used to be quite a heavy smoker, right? I mean, I'd smoke a pack in a half a day. And I knew that wasn't doing me any good.
Therapist: Right.
Client: I mean the thing is when you're a-- I mean, I've always smoked. So, but when you're young and you're a sportsman, you know—
Therapist: You kinda juggle those two things and kinda--
Client: Well, the two things they balance out, you know and everybody else is
Therapist: You still run and have a cigarette?
Client: You know, you pass a cigarette down the backline almost, don't you? You know, just before the game gets—
Therapist: Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, part of the culture.
Client: Yeah, part of the of the whole thing. And it's changed a bit now, because in my day when we were playing, of course, it was a very much more of a social game, which was spent-spent in the rugby club.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: That's why you played and it was a big buddy-buddy thing.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: That was rugby and cricket was the same really.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Um, but now—
Therapist: But over the years, you've actually reduced your smoking or you've stopped altogether or at times?
Client: Well I-I, yeah. I was getting a bit sort of-- I was getting a bit, you know, a bit wheezy and I thought, ""I'll cut this out.""
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: But I enjoy smoking. I really do enjoy it. So I cut it down to I suppose it's about 10 a day now.
Therapist: Okay, so you meant to reduce.
Client: Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: You were noticing that it's having an impact on your breathing and health wasn't so good.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: When you related that to your smoking, so you managed to reduce your smoking.
Client: Yeah, yeah. I sort of—
Therapist: So you've made our decision to do that?
Client: it-it-it's-- you know, she will, ""Why don't you give up? You've gone so far, why don't you just stop?"" But I don't want to.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: It's-it's-- I-I enjoy it, um—
Therapist: Yeah, and it's hard to get to stop something you enjoy, isn't it?
Client: Well, yeah. I mean, you know, the thing is that you get to, you know, you've got to-- when you get down to that, you, uh, you have to regulate sort of-
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You know, you have to be quite strong-willed about, I suppose, in a way.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: So you say, ""Okay, well, you don't have a cigarette unless you have a cup of coffee. [laughs]
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know.
Therapist: But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?
Client: Oh, yeah, yeah. I have two sugars. A couple of sugar in coffee. Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: So we cut that down as I say.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: But the problem goes that coffee, we're up to 8 or so, 10 cups of coffee a day now.
Therapist: You're drinking more coffee. So what I've heard you say so far is, if I can just start right back from the beginning and you used to come in and sais, ""I went to the doctor."" You went for-- it sounds like you went for just a checkup.
Client: No, you know, there's a friend of mine, one of the guys down the rugby club, he said- he said, ""I'm going for my annual, you know-
Therapist: MIT.
Client: -warranty of fitness, sort of thing, you know. And I thought, now that's an idea, not been to one of those.
Therapist: Got to check out, why not?
Client: So I'm 55, and you read in the papers, you know, it's that at 55 you will-- you know, heart disease is more prevalent
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: -and all these sorts of things that you get around this middle-age time. So I thought, ""Well, I'll go and have one."" And frankly, when I went along, I was very confident. I thought, you know, the doctor is going to saying, ""Hmm, I wish I was as healthy as you,"" sort of thing.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, but unfortunately, uh, he-he came up with this. And it's the only thing I think he really came up with. I think-
Therapist: So everything else looked pretty good?
Client: My cholesterol is quite good, not too bad.
Therapist: Cholesterol good, your weight is good.
Client: Yeah-yeah. Not too bad.
Therapist: Um, you are smoking, but you've managed to reduce that.
Client: Well, yeah, I've cut it down, yeah. I mean, that's been three years, mind.
Therapist: And anything else, you know, you go ticking down the list. The tire is good, oil good.
Client: Absolutely.
Therapist: So we're looking good.
Client: And then we come to this-
Therapist: And ah, hang on.
Client: -too much sugar in the tank, or something. I don't know.
Therapist: Yeah, there's something wrong with the, uh, with this bit.
Client: So, yeah.
Therapist: And it doesn't quite fit with how you see your own lifestyle.
Client: No.
Therapist: Because you've-- it sounds like what you've been doing, you've made some conscious effort to be aware of some of those things you might think are important.
Client: I mean, yeah. I mean, you know, the thing is, you see, the thing is, and I mean, and probably you've-- I think you've heard this before, but people, they turn around, oh, uh, you know, doom and gloom prophets, you shouldn't drink.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: You shouldn't smoke.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And then I think to myself, ""Well, maybe I shouldn't socialize."" And then after that, ""Well, maybe I shouldn't be alive.""
Therapist: So like a domino effect, and they'll all be just sitting-
Client: You know. I mean, what-what-what's going on here? This is- this is- this is so many people's lives.
Therapist: Mm-hm.
Client: And um, I suppose, you know, if it came down to it, then, and somebody said, ""Well, you can solve this problem by taking a pill once a day, um, you know, it will keep it down, and there will be no problems,"" Then I-I could go with that. But what I don't want to do, um, the doctor was saying, or insinuating, that I'd have to change my lifestyle.
Therapist: A bit broad kind of like you've gotta change everything.
Client: Yeah. It was um, and I-I said, well, no. I'm sorry. [coughs] I'm not going to change my lifestyle. I've got to where I am. I'm reasonably happy. Okay, I wish I wasn't separated. Okay, I wish my kids were-were still around, um, you know. One of them is off now in, um, in-- back in Europe playing rugby in France.
Therapist: Yeah. And your thought was, yeah, right, I hear that, but actually, I don't want to make all these big changes in my life.
Client: No, I don't want to, because I don't feel that I need to.
Therapist: Feel like you need to. Yeah.
Client: I mean, it's you know, why?
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Um, I can't argue with a medical professional, Mark, because I know nothing, you know.
Therapist: The test, is the test, and experience, yeah.
Client: So, I mean, what-what-what-what suggestions would you have? I mean, what-what sort of-
Therapist: I don't know. I think it's up to you where we start, and that's the question I've got in my mind. You've mentioned a couple of things that you've already made some effort, or been conscious of. You've mentioned the diet, you've mentioned your smoking, those are two quite important aspects that we often talk about here in how people work.
Client: Is smoking related to diabetes then?
Therapist: It can have an impact, yes. So smoking, um, affects your blood system, so it hardens the arteries, um, and over time, it can have a significant impact on the healing of wounds. So people with Type II diabetes, often, if they get a cut, or a bruise, or something, it takes a long time to heal. Smoking reduces the amount of oxygen in your system, so that can further, you know, limit the time it takes your body to heal.
Client: Oh.
Therapist: So we know that smoking and Type II diabetes together-
Client: Don't help.
Therapist: -isn't a good combination.
Client: Is it okay if you have one without the other? I'm sorry, it's a silly question. [laughs]
Therapist: Well, the question is, I suppose, that I have for you is, where would you think, for you, would be a good place to start? If you were gonna make any changes, even small changes at the beginning, rather than just thinking, oh, I got to change everything, which it sounds like you're not prepared to, you know, do a whole lifestyle change, and I don't think that's what we're talking about here. Where would you feel most comfortable to start if you were gonna make any changes at all?
Client: Where would I start? Well, I-- What if about if I cut down on sugar in the coffee? If we could have long blacks, no milk, and no sugar.
Therapist: Yeah. Hmm, that might be a start.
Client: I think I could- I think I could probably handle that.
Therapist: Hm. What we also find is that people make these little changes, small changes, and that starts to kind of well, it makes them-
Client: Something of a rollover effect.
Therapist: -rollover, the domino effect starts to happen, and they start looking at other aspects.
Client: Domino effect, yeah.
Therapist: So rather than thinking, ""oh, my God, I have to change all these things. I've gotta stop smoking, I've gotta exercise more, I've gotta, you know, start eating more fruit and vegetables,"" you might start with these small changes, and then-
Client: I mean, how much exercise should I do a week?
Therapist: Um, I-I'm reluctant to give a prescription for that because I think it's really up to you. And I think it depends on how things go, as to how much you need to do.
Client: Right.
Therapist: You mentioned earlier on, the doctors talking about you monitoring your blood sugar.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So on how-- It depends on how-how that goes. Let's say, if you started doing that and you do some more exercise, you start to have longer blacks, rather than short blacks with lots of sugar. And you get down the sugar and you find your blood sugar starts to come down, then we're heading in the right direction.
Client: Okay, so—
Therapist: So it's really, I suppose, up to how things go for you, and you get that feedback. And if that's going in the right direction, you carry on doing and do some more of that.
Client: So, a-are we saying then that-that, really all I need to do, for this moment, is I can forget about everything, but cut out the sugar, uh, in the coffee and the milk-- I don't know, but you might as well, you know, milk without sugar is silly. But, um, if we do that, is that where we start?
Therapist: I think where we start is where you feel comfortable starting.
Client: Well, I mean that's something that's not difficult to do.
Therapist: Apples for breakfast.
Client: You start off at breakfast and get yourself an apple, a bit-a bit of apple and-and so on. Um—
Therapist: So what I'm hearing you're kind of saying is, that there's-- You're now starting to think of some very useful little starting points.
Client: Maybe.
Therapist: Not huge changes, but some little things you could do.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And it's kind of dawning on you there may be some possibilities here for making some changes. Let me ask you this. Um, let's say you put some of these things in place and you start to make some of these small changes.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Um, where do you see that taking you in the next set of three, four, five years? You know, where do you want to be in three to four years' time? What would be your ideal picture?
Client: Well, you know, and this is difficult because I don't feel unhealthy now.
Therapist: No.
Client: So, I suppose it would be fun to-- Maybe I should join a club or two, that's what I'm thinking because I'll be with mates.
Therapist: Yeah? You like the social aspect?
Client: I love the social aspect of it, and, um, there's-there's-- I know there's a bar in this club as well. I-- Don't-don't misunderstand me, I don't drink-
Therapist: No, no, I get that. I get that.
Client: -till-- You know, I'm not an alcoholic or anything like that, I—
Therapist: So part of that whole keeping fit and exercise stuff is actually the social side of it, isn't it?
Client: So yeah, so to get that balance, and maybe that's what I'm actually missing in life, and maybe this is, um-- I mean yes I do get up in the morning sometimes, and I suppose I do feel a bit—
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: You know? Even after a decent night's sleep, you know?
Therapist: Haven't quite that-
Client: And you need-- I'm getting this cup of coffee and maybe I'm—
Therapist: And the coffee helps a little bit because it perks you up?
Client: And that gets me going. Yeah.
Therapist: And the sugar in it helps too.
Client: Yeah, the sugar gives me the boost, I suppose. I-it's fantastic.
Therapist: So what I'm hearing is that your life, your work, your routines are-- Sometimes you're driving or you've got to keep awake, get up in the morning sometimes and you haven't quite got that buzz or the energy. You need a shot, and then throughout the day you might need just more shots to keep that energy up.
Client: Hmm. If I give up sugar in my coffee, give up the milk, black coffees, right?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: if I find some social form of exercise, like squash.
Therapist: And an activity which has got a starting to finish and it's something you do for a slot.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And then there's maybe some social aspects to it as well.
Client: Yeah, and then—
Therapist: You can see some benefits and some enjoyment that.
Client: And then, you know, give this, say, six months, I don't know what period it would be, then go back to the GP and say, ""Test me again.""
Therapist: That sounds like a great plan.
Client: And so maybe that would, uh—
Therapist: Yeah, sounds like a good idea.
Client: Maybe it's an idea. I mean—
Therapist: I think anything you do, it has to be something you've decided. You know, just start where you want to start. You've mentioned some really good ideas about possibly getting a little bit more exercise into your life, doing something like squash or something of that nature. You've mentioned some really good ideas about reducing the amount of sugar you-you-you're-you're intaking during the day, and coffee is a good place to start. Having an apple for breakfast, I think you mentioned that, a bit of fruit.
Client: Yeah, like my wife used to. Yeah.
Therapist: Those are some really good ideas and good starting points. So thinking about it like that, what-- Where are you now? What's your-- What-what-- Where-where is your thinking now?
Client: Well, you see, I mean, I'm thinking, ""Actually it might not be a bad idea this,"" because [chuckles] it would mean I could socialize harder, couldn't I? No, no I'm just joking. Uh, but, um, yeah, I mean, why not? Why not? Why not? It might be fun, it's a new path.
Therapist: What's to lose? What's to gain?
Client: Well, it would appear that there is something to gain, and-- I mean, I-- What do I lose? I don't know until I do it. But I'm thinking that if I do it and I do what I'm enjoying doing, I won't miss what I'm not doing. Does that make sense?
Therapist: It does make sense, yeah.
Client: Um, yeah I don't mind. I-- It's not a—
Therapist: So when you look at it, there's probably more to gain from making these changes than there is to lose.
Client: I'll talk to Billy about, um-- Billy is, um, he's the gym bloke.
Therapist: Right.
Client: I'll have a word with him because I'm due down the club tonight.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Really.
Therapist: So you've got to work these things on your mind. You know, the-- And workout where's the place to start.
Client: Yeah, I think that you say where-where you're at now, where you're going, where—
Therapist: Yeah.

Client: Mm-hmm. Um, yeah, my asthma has just been out of control lately and my doctor says that might be connected to Oscar.
Therapist: Hmm. So, what- can you let me know or-or what do you know about your asthma and the things that affected or might make it worse?
Client: Um, I've got allergy testing. It's just, uh, the dust makes it bad. I thought the smoking was the main thing-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -that's cut down. Um, and then they said the drinking might contribute to it, too. So, I got a lot of different things I'm working on. So that's what I know.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: The drinking, the smoking and the dust that I got, the, um, the scratch test for.
Therapist: Right.
Client: And-and-and that's what I know, and that I take the medicine for it.

Client: No, I've had it for-for 12 years and now it's a concern. I don't understand.

Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: -and-and I think you mentioned done-done a little bit towards that.
Client: Mm-hmm. I'm a little I'm a couple of down. I used to drink four at night, now I'm down to three at least.
Therapist: Okay, okay.
Client: Uh-huh.
Therapist: So now almost like that's not good enough, like now you have to, now it's the dog and now-
Client: Mm-hmm, what's next, yeah, yeah.
Therapist: -what's next. Right. Okay. So, I mean, there is certainly a lot of evidence that pets in the home and the dander from their fur can make asthma worse.
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: -but I wonder what are your experiences with Oscar, you know, when he's in the house or-or maybe sleeping near you or you're around him, what happens with your asthma symptoms?
Client: Well, we keep them clean, like he's cleaned. So, all the dander doesn't really make sense, but I have been noticing that sometimes when he comes on the bed or just beside, I wheeze a little bit, but I think it has to do with, um, the hair, the, in my lungs cleaning itself up from the smoking.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: So, I don't know if it's that-that's where I'm confused. I don't know how this could be happening.
Therapist: Hmm. So, it doesn't make total sense to you that-that it's all Oscar's fault and that-

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: So Tom, this infection is been pretty painful for you but we have antibiotics. If you take it faithfully for 10 days, I'm sure that your infection will be gone. Can you do that?
Client: Definitely.
Therapist: And do you mind if we talk about a screening form that you filled out earlier today on drug use?
Client: Okay.
Therapist: Let's take a look. It says that on occasion you use, uh, drugs other than medical reasons. Which drugs do you use?
Client: I do some meth.
Therapist: Snort it, smoke it?
Client: Snort it, always snort it.
Therapist: Don't inject it?
Client: Mm-mm.
Therapist: Use any other drugs?
Client: Just, you know, some alcohol.
Therapist: And, uh, um, you do this how often?
Client: Meth?
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: Um, two, three times a month.
Therapist: So you're an occasional meth user. You don't use very often?
Client: Right.
Therapist: Only snort it?
Client: Right.
Therapist: Well, as I think you know, Methamphetamine use is associated with some health risks. And the amount that you're using it-it puts you in a category that we consider a risky user. And that contrasts with someone who it says addicted, um, someone who's a heavy user but it's not in a healthy category because people who use Methamphetamine tend to run to a number of consequences. And actually one of them is, um, sexually transmitted diseases. Do you suppose that your STD might be associated with your Methamphetamine use?
Client: Yeah, it could be because, uh, I was high when I had unprotected sex and I would not do that if I were not high.
Therapist: So you're normally very careful and you use protection when you have sex?
Client: Definitely, yeah.
Therapist: And it seems to you that methamphetamine may have clouded your judgment?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Anything else happening with Methamphetamine in your life? Is it affecting you in any way?
Client: No, I mean, no. I mean, like I said, I only do it in clubs, you know, with my friends, uh, two or three times a month at-at the most. Um, uh, I don't think it's really having other impacts. But I'm-I'm concerned about this one. I never expected to get gonorrhea.
Therapist: Yeah, you know, I'm concerned bout it too and I'd actually recommend that you stop using Methamphetamine altogether. And, um, there-there are a lot of reasons for this but that's-that's would be my recommendation.
Client: I-I understand but it's I think that would be a hard thing for me to do. You know, I mean, I know I should but, I mean, that's like my whole social life. You know, I mean, all my friends go to these clubs. That's where- that's where I see them. You know, that's my sex life basically and, uh, meth is just- it's just a part of it. You know, I mean, everyone is doing it there. You know, so it's while I would like to stop it's-it's kind of hard to think about doing that right away.
Therapist: So you recognize Methamphetamine has some problems associated with it and you also on the balance see that a lot of your social life and your sex life involves Methamphetamine, it would be difficult to quit using?
Client: Yeah, I don't think it would be easy but I'm not saying that I'm not willing to try.
Therapist: Well, if you were to, um, consider how ready you are to stop using Methamphetamine completely-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: -with zero being not ready at all-
Client: Mm.
Therapist: -and 10 being ready, where would you put yourself?
Client: Uh, three.
Therapist: Why not a one or a two?
Client: I mean, this has been really uncomfortable, you know, gonorrhea is a really bad experience. And, uM, I know I don't think the same, you know, when I'm- when I'm on it. And, uh, I mean, what I have is bad enough, I could easily get AIDS. I could get HIV the same way. So that scares me a lot. That's why it's higher than a one or two.
Therapist: Are there any other concerns that you have about Methamphetamine?
Client: Well, I do just snort it but you don't know what it's cut with, you know, there could be something, you know. It could be really bad, um, if it was cut with something dangerous or something. I mean, I-I worry about that sometimes.
Therapist: Mm, so when I was first talking to you, I thought that you'd have a very, um, really not much interest in not stoping using Methamphetamine but it sounds like you have a number of reasons why you really would like to stop using Methamphetamine. And that is, um, that it might be cut with something else, um, you could get another ST- STD including HIV.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Um, what do you think would make it easier for you to cut down or quit using Methamphetamine?
Client: Something else to do on weekends, you know, different social life.
Therapist: How could you get a different social life?
Client: It's the hard thing, I mean, almost everybody I know uses it.
Therapist: Is there anyone in your life who doesn't use methamphetamine?
Client: My sister.
Therapist: Does she-- Have you talked to her about your meth use?

Return ""simple"", ""complex"" or ""none"" based on whether the last therapist's utterance  has a simple, complex or no reflection. 
Feel free to return none as the therapist utterance might not have any reflection.

Here are a few examples.

Examples:

Example 1
Client: But-but the wheezing is something that I've definitely noticed a little bit.
Therapist: I guess I also wonder whether, regardless of-of if your asthma symptoms are connected to Oscar, that may be part of you feels like it's worth it because he's been-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: -such a big part of your life for so long.
Answer: complex

Example 2
Client: Um, I'm just- yeah I just like to have a few drinks. I mean, you know, obviously, I-I have, uh, this diagnosed condition, and-and I think, you know, if I were able to, you know, maybe take a few hits off of the joint and have a couple of beers, I think that's about the same as taking the medicine.
Therapist: Well, you know, what, I-- There are a lot of people that wouldn't disagree with you on that exactly. You know, so, um, uh, but I know that they-they were never quite sure how they were all interacting all together. Like the, um- the weed kind of tends to make people a little paranoid anyway.
Client: Yeah, I-I-I got to be careful with it. If I take more than a hit or two of it, it-it-it can be a bit of a problem.
Therapist: Yeah. Why, what happens if you take a little too much of it?
Answer: none

Example 3
Client: That's a good way to sum it up. And it's-- Well, you understand it, uh, it's just- it's not good.
Therapist: Mm. So, and then you said, you don't like how it makes you act, um, if you can tell me a little bit about that.
Answer: simple

Example 4
Client: Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know.
Therapist: But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?
Answer: complex

Example 5
Client: I wanna stay friends with them. I don't want- I don't want them to just-
Therapist: You don't wanna lose your support group, yeah. You just wanna them to support you in being healthy, while helping them, raising the babe, and so we're just taking path B. You don't wanna lose them, just maybe the lifestyle it sounds like.
Answer: none

Example 6
Client: Um, I mean, I guess- I guess I need some strategies for figuring out how to ease stress without, I guess, getting high.
Therapist: Okay. And that's a very good reason for being here. Um, can you talk to me about maybe some of your-- the goals that you have?
Answer: none

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: Thanks for coming in today. I guess you've, uh, sat in that seat with lots of people like me in the past.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: Yeah. And you have some ideas about that and some experiences about that. So today I wanna- be good for us to talk about that and, um, I'm really interested to know what you've been thinking about in terms of what you may wanna change in your life 'cause we're gonna be working together for a while here.
Client: Right. Neat. What, um, what have I changed, what am I—
Therapist: What you've been thinking about, um, over the last little while about getting your life back on track. 'Cause I noticed you've—
Client: I've been thinking about how easy it would be to deal P again.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I've been thinking about, um, how I could actually set myself up the right way doing it the wrong way.
Therapist: Sure. So what I'm picking up is-is that-that-that's a life that you know a lot about.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: And you can make lots of money and set yourself up well. What's the other side, because I guess when I talk to guys like yourself who have done time, often they're thinking about actually, mm, maybe life can be with different. So I'm wondering where-where you're at with the kind of thinking about—
Client: Well, at the end of, you know, that last week inside, I was- I had that kind of, okay, what's next buzz? And, you know, it just doesn't work out here.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: I don't have a, uh, uh, I don't know what that is.
Therapist: Sure. So life on the outside is pretty different than the kind of-
Client: Yes.
Therapist: -the expectation of life on the inside something?
Client: Yeah, it's worse.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So tell me how you've been managing. 'Cause I don't know if you'd been back dealing? How have you been managing to-to-to—
Client: I haven't yet, I mean-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -the, uh, the offer's there.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Um, I don't know why I haven't said that I will yet but I mean-
Therapist: Uh, tell me-
Client: -it's there.
Therapist: It's there and-and-and you've a lot of contacts?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: You've been in the system, so lots of context. So this isn't a new challenge for you.
Client: No.
Therapist: So what stopped you over the last-- How long have you been out now?
Client: How long have I been out?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Three weeks, one day.
Therapist: Three weeks, isn't it?
Client: Three weeks, one day.
Therapist: So what's been there? What's it about that you haven't done in three weeks one day?
Client: I don't know.
Therapist: 22 days you've actually made a decision not to-to pick up your old life and continue on.
Client: Um, I'd- I- you know, I kind of told myself not to, you know, just before I left. And then I'm just kind of with it and I don't quite know why. [clears throat] I dunno, if, uh, there's no real reason why I haven't yet. It's just that I don't- I just don't think it'll work the way I always dream it will you know, I see myself up like, whatever, if I do that again, the next leg is a long one. A real long one.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And I-I can't go back there. There's no way I'm going back there.
Therapist: Right. So the one hand you've-you-you could sit yourself up and-and take the risk, but on the other hand, you know, that actually it might not last?
Client: No, never lasts.
Therapist: Never lasts. Mm. You seem like a bit of a crossroads to me.
Client: Yep. I've been in crossroads for 12 years.
Therapist: Mm. But there've been times when those crossroads would be more sort of focused than other times.
Client: Yeah. And- [crosstalk]
Therapist: Yeah. And it sounds like maybe like-
Client: -sort of opposite, yeah.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: You know, we're in the middle, you know, and it's actually at the moment, I guess.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But I don't know. You know, that's quite clear that no fucking idea.
Therapist: Okay. Okay. So—
Client: Do you have an idea?
Therapist: No. Well, I've-I've got lots of ideas, but I'm really interested to hearing your ideas kind of first though because you know, and there might be some things that we can work on.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: But I guess what I'm really interested in is-is you've made a commitment 22 days, drug-free. Haven't gone back into that lifestyle. What-what's keeping you, 'cause you're at the crossroads, you kind of just pause there at the moment. I'm not sure about this other bit over here. What keeping you in that place?
Client: Fiona?
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Tell me about Fiona?
Client: She's told me that it's over if I do it. You know, I mean, she-- What tell you about, Fiona I mean she's been with me. She's the one who stayed through all the shit. And I owe her-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -something.
Therapist: Okay. So you've been with Fiona for how long?
Client: 12 years.
Therapist: 12 years. Okay. So she's stood by you then for the time, [crosstalk] but this time she said, it happens again I'm out of here?
Client: Yeah. She's actually got the black and white line down now.
Therapist: Okay. And it sounds like you're listening to that black and white line.
Client: It's pretty she- you know, she could be pretty full-on.
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: Yeah, so it's hard to ignore that line.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean. And it comes with a whole lot of different rules, and you know, she's never been quite like she is now.
Therapist: Okay. So something's changed in your relationship between you, yeah?
Client: Yeah. I think she has. I don't think I have.
Therapist: Okay. So what's Fiona want you from you?
Client: She just wants me. I mean, she just wants someone to be there. Me. She-she remembers me and she wants- she wants him.
Therapist: She wants him. So which him does she want, Daryl?
Client: The one that, you know—
Therapist: Does she want the- did she want the-the him that she fell in love with and saw great things in?
Client: Yeah, that's the one.
Therapist: Or does she want the-the-the-the him that's- that keeps on getting into trouble?
Client: No, no. No one would want him. I don't want him. He's a fuckwit, right? She wants the one that she fell in love with.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So what's it gonna take to reclaim this Daryl that she fell in love with?
Client: If I had the answer to that, I wouldn't need to be sitting here.
Therapist: Sure, yeah.
Client: And I mean, I honest- I don't know, man. I don't know. I-I wish I knew somewhere I could start that, you know, could give it to her, but I-I can't. I-I don't know.
Therapist: All right. Well, let's-let's just play with this idea a little bit, Daryl. So what did Fiona fall in love with? What were the qualities of Daryl that she said, ""This is him""?
Client: I was pretty romantic. I mean, I was pretty quite smooth, and, um, you know, I was on top of my game, like, she- and she loved it. And we used to laugh in the [unintelligible 00:06:45], you know? And just- it was always really sweet, and people used to say, ""Oh, man, you two. You two have just got it,"" you know? And we lost it, so whatever that was, that's what she wants. We were young. How do you become young? Uh, you know, I'm old, and we'll keep growing old, but you know?
Therapist: I know.
Client: Like if I'm not careful, I will be.
Therapist: Sure. Everyone will age, but that will happen on time.
Client: Yeah, certainly.
Therapist: Um, but that's okay. So-so it's she fell in love with this, the sense of fun, the sense of Daryl, and things have changed, but she's still with you?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah. And you're still with her?
Client: Yeah, yep.
Therapist: Yeah. So catch me up with the conversations you've had with Fiona about this crossroads you're at. You know, these 22 days, you haven't gone back, you've coming out and you're not back? You could pick up this dealing quite easily and probably some workout here tomorrow and get back into it.
Client: You know what? She hasn't even talked about the dealing, like, she won't even broach that subject. That's how black and white she is. She's- she'll be- she offers suggestions, you know? What I could do, and- or I kind of go with that, but none of them are-- You know, it's lovely that she's really finding things, but they're not the things. I mean, it-- I started kind of placating her and making it okay to keep giving me suggestions, but like, I need to come up with something because it's like awesome love, but you know, not in love, and she's getting sick of it already.
Therapist: Okay. All right. So-so back together, things are starting to get tense at home, and your relationship a little bit?
Client: A little bit that. Yeah, little-little bit tense. Yeah, that's fair.
Therapist: Yeah. Don't put words in your mouth. I'm sure if that is—
Client: No, they are.
Therapist: Oh, yeah? Yeah?
Client: I mean, not like they have been because we've only just started on the new road, but I mean, yeah, tense is the right word.
Therapist: Second, I'd like to talk, Daryl, about this all- whole idea, that's this crossroads idea, yep? So on the one hand here, you've got this 12 year history of being in the other system and done some time and being away from Fiona, but you're now back, sitting back together, and you've got some choice about where to go. So, in that 'where to go', what ideas have you been thinking about in terms of where this-this Daryl, non-dealing [crosstalk] guy—
Client: Well, I don't know. I haven't got little, um, nuggets of where I could go. I've just got like this feeling that I should go somewhere.
Therapist: Okay. Yep. So a part of you knows you need to go something different, but the direction doesn't seem to be that clear at the moment?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: It [unintelligible 00:09:33] picking up?
Client: Yeah. No idea.
Therapist: No idea. Okay. So I'm wondering, you've been in the system a while. You're now 34, is it right from the pick-up?
Client: [nods].
Therapist: Yeah. So, you know, often at 34, guys start to think about being with a girl in their life and what's important. And-and you would have also been part- not as a guy, so they've actually made some shifts and changes and thought, ""Time to move on"".
Client: Yeah. Well, um—
Therapist: And now you've got—
Client: Not many.
Therapist: Not many?
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: But some.
Client: Um, oh, I've got. Yeah, one. [chuckles]
Therapist: One?
Client: One.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Mm, yeah.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Okay, so, um—
Therapist: Tell me something about that.
Client: Well, he-he was- he was inside with me the first time I was ever inside, and now he's a drug counselor.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: So, he's the- he did it.
Therapist: He did it?
Client: I don't know how the fuck he did that, but, 'cause because he wasn't even a real addict, he was just-- Well, I mean, I don't know. He's very good with people.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Really good at talking, and, uh, but anyway, I don't know how he did it.
Therapist: Cool. So how interested would you be to find out more information about how he did it? 'Cause I'm thinking about this is someone who you know, you've done time with, got a relationship.
Client: Yeah, but I can't ever be a drug counselor.
Therapist: No, I'm not suggesting you-- No, not about being a drug counselor, but about he made that transition from-from being involved in crime-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -to a transition about being in a different place.
Client: Yeah. I think he would have found some higher power. They find-- I'm not gonna find one of them.
Therapist: Okay, no 12-step higher power idea?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So that might work for him, but what might work for you?
Client: I don't know. That's why I'm here.
Therapist: Sure.
Client: I don't know what that is.
Therapist: Okay, so part of being here with me, and the work we might do, will be to find- try and find- search for that-
Client: Okay.
Therapist: -thing. Whatever it is.
Client: Good luck.
Therapist: Well, it's a search, isn't it?
Client: Yeah, I don't mean to be rude-
Therapist: No.
Client: -but I do mean it's a big ask.
Therapist: Yep, it is a big ask. So what qualities would you need to have to-to go there?
Client: Fucking guts.
Therapist: Guts? Yeah?
Client: Is it a quality?
Therapist: I think it is.
Client: Yeah, I'd need some of them.
Therapist: Yeah? So you're the sort of guy, Daryl, with guts?
Client: Am I?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: No, not yet.
Therapist: Not yet?
Client: Well, no I'm not.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: No, I don't have that-that-that much courage.\
Therapist: Yet you're sitting here with me today-
Client: Oh, I have to.
Therapist: -and-and-and you're talking about stuff.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Well, you're sitting here, and you're talking with me-
Client: Oh, okay.
Therapist: -about stuff that's-that's quite deep-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -in a way. Um, that takes guts. That takes courage.
Client: All right.
Therapist: In my view, it does.
Client: Okay.
Therapist: 'Cause you could've come in here and said-
Client: It's a bit awkward.
Therapist: -""Look, Ken, you know, I'll come in, report in, I'm outta here.""
Client: Ah, yeah. I could've done that
Therapist: You could've done that, but you're not. So I'm wondering what's different? 'Cause you may have done that in the past, I don't know, Daryl, with other people like me, but-but sounds like something's different this time.
Client: I'm older, you know? It's not as much fun.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: I used to take the piss outta you guys-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -all day long. We all do, but-
Therapist: Sure.
Client: -it's not funny. I mean, and you're-you're a good guy, I imagine. I mean, in fact, you don't deserve my shit. I just-- I don't know. Good luck.
Therapist: I kind of see a sense of sadness there when you have to kind of think about this.
Client: Oh, sadness. You know, I don't wanna wallow, you know? You know, you've gotta take, you know-- You make your own opportunity in life, don't you?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I just never did.
Therapist: Okay. So I'm interested in this idea, let's, uh-- Opportunities come and go all the time.
Client: Do they?
Therapist: They do.
Client: All right. Not to me.
Therapist: Well you said before you had an opportunity to pick up and start dealing again.
Client: Oh, yeah. Oh, heaps of those opportunities.
Therapist: And-and so-so-so there's opportunities- there's opportunities in one world, and I'm wondering about what might make it hard to see opportunities in a different world?
Client: Yeah, well, the different world isn't offering me opportunities. The different world is offering me a night shift, and minimum wage, and, you know, nothing. So it's like, set-set yourself up, set your goal up, or, um, don't, and that's your-your pro-social living, and that's your, you know, old behaviors.
Therapist: Sure, sure. You're in the system-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: -you're not in the system. Pick up that, where is it gonna take you?
Client: The system?
Therapist: Yeah, what-what's gonna happen if you start dealing again?
Client: Man, I've been fighting that system-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -and all it takes me back is to the-the inside-
Therapist: Okay, okay.
Client: -I mean—
Therapist: So-So again, I'm-I'm wondering about this other world, and you're saying it doesn't look to attractive at the moment.
Client: Well, I can't see it.
Therapist: You can't se it?
Client: You know what, if I knew what they'd look like-
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: -I-I might, you know, buy that.
Therapist: Yeah? You just described to me how it looked like a minute ago.
Client: Did I?
Therapist: Minimum wage-
Client: Oh yeah.
Therapist: -night shift, petrol station.
Client: Yeah, that's not much fun. That doesn't look very good.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah, that looks really hard.
Therapist: Yeah? It is really hard.
Client: I know that's the right thing, uh, don't get me wrong.
Therapist: Sure.
Client: That is gut right there, going to a job you hate, going home, cooking yet missus a dinner, looking after your kids. I mean, that is-- That's what it real mean does, but I don't have that-- Th-those guts to do- to do what you do.
Therapist: Sure. We talked about courage before and you've got the guts to be talking with me about this stuff today, and I'm wondering if you actually do have some courage to think about these ideas. I'm not saying that pumping gas at minimum wage is where you wanna go, but-but the guts to actually start steeping into this other world. I wonder if you do have, I'm-I'm-I'm just not sure.
Client: I-- Hmm, maybe.
Therapist: Maybe. You're not convinced at the moment, I understand that and, um—
Client: No. You know, convince me because, you know, I kind of want to be.
Therapist: Sure. Well, it's hard to me to convince you-
Client: Right.
Therapist: -'cause this is your life and this is your story, and you-you've got to walk your life and I can't walk your life for you. I only walk my. And so, but I can walk with you on this life to try and think about-- 'Cause I-I-- You know, I-I've no interest in actually you falling over and going back into-into a lifestyle a crime 'cause I know where it'll take you. And I'm hearing that with your relationship, where it's going to take your relationship too, [unintelligible 00:16:39] got the bottom line drawn pretty clearly.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: So it seems like what's gonna push in this direction, just tip that balance a little bit to give this other world of go? Because it is new, it's different. It means doing stuff, a lot of stuff actually that-that's kind of mundane.
Client: It is the little things, yeah, like waking up, and having a cup of tea and sitting on the porch is kind of cool.
Therapist: It's kind of cool?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Not part of on the wire?
Client: No, you don't get to sit outside-
Therapist: No?
Client: -on the porch.
Therapist: You don't. And who's sitting on the porch with you?
Client: No one. It's morning, it's just me.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: Birds, trees, yada yada.
Therapist: Cool. So I'm picking up this world actually has the freedom to you to be your own man?
Client: Mm, you know, maybe.
Therapist: Maybe?
Client: I don't-- You know, that-that was nice. If it was full of bits like that, sure, but I mean, you know, eventually you have to go off to your job and-
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: -you know, pay your-your wages, I mean your-your mortgage and-and-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -it's just massive.
Therapist: Yeah it is. It is.
Client: It is.
Therapist: Absolutely massive. And, uh-- So, is there a challenge you're up to, to start creating some-some-some of that sort of world for Fiona? 'Cause I'm hearing that—
Client: You know, people like me are unaccepted into that world though. You know? I've got-- I don't have qualifications. All my mates are in Australia working awesome jobs, mining for 160K a year, you know? Just being men digging holes. Like, if I could do that, yeah, all good but fuck, I have just come out of prison, I don't have any NCEA. I, uh, I had one opportunity and I fucked that because I can't do night shift 'cause I'm lazy. You know? Maybe the world is giving me opportunities and I just don't need them. Maybe I can't do that.
Therapist: Sure. So what I'm hearing is, you're not convinced at the moment.
Client: No, I'm definitely not convinced.
Therapist: No. So what would convince you to-to make that shift? 'Cause I hear a lot of kind of-- And in this hard, like, y-you've done time and then once you've got a record, the employers- you know, we know, I know that. That's-that's not easy. You can't just wonder into a job, a high-paying job and go, ""Pick me, pick me, pick me."" I know that.
Client: No.
Therapist: You know that.
Client: Yeah, I know.
Therapist: So, um-- And-and maybe it's about small steps and first steps.
Client: Yeah. I mean, yeah, it is obviously, it is first steps, but I mean, what's that? What's the first step into the pro-social life?
Therapist: Well, you trying to get a job, maybe and get into some routine.
Client: I just know if I get a job that I hate, I just won't do it.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: You know, I can make in an hour what I can make in a night or a week of nights. It's pretty-- You know, from where I'm from that a really-- You know, there's no decision at all, that's just like, what are you up to if you don't?
Therapist: Yeah. I'm confused though at the moment because you're saying, ""Yeah, I could make in a night what you make in a week,"" but you've haven't. 22-22 days-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -and you haven't done that. So-so tell me what that's about.
Client: I just told myself I wouldn't this time and then Fiona said, ""You will not"" this time.
Therapist: So you told yourself you wouldn't, so you're once you- you're the sort of guy that once you make a decision you're gonna go, you're staunch with that decision?
Client: Yeah, even if it's the wrong one, yes.
Therapist: Oh, it's a decision whether it's right or wrong-- It's not gonna be-
Client: Yeah, but I'm that kinda guy.
Therapist: Yeah, you're that kinda guy okay, so once you make a decision. So you made a decision that you're not gonna- you're not gonna go back to dealing?

Therapist: Yeah. Why, what happens if you take a little too much of it?
Answer: none

Example 3
Client: That's a good way to sum it up. And it's-- Well, you understand it, uh, it's just- it's not good.
Therapist: Mm. So, and then you said, you don't like how it makes you act, um, if you can tell me a little bit about that.
Answer: simple

Example 4
Client: Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know.
Therapist: But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?
Answer: complex

Example 5
Client: I wanna stay friends with them. I don't want- I don't want them to just-
Therapist: You don't wanna lose your support group, yeah. You just wanna them to support you in being healthy, while helping them, raising the babe, and so we're just taking path B. You don't wanna lose them, just maybe the lifestyle it sounds like.
Answer: none

Example 6
Client: Um, I mean, I guess- I guess I need some strategies for figuring out how to ease stress without, I guess, getting high.
Therapist: Okay. And that's a very good reason for being here. Um, can you talk to me about maybe some of your-- the goals that you have?
Answer: none

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: So, you've got this dream by the sounds of it, which is, you know, to have a partner, and a house, and a nice car-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -so don't forget the nice car, and some kids, and be a- be a good dad-
Client: Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: -to your kids. So, is this dream starting to-- I am getting a picture of?
Client: Yeah, it'd be good.
Therapist: Yeah. Okay. So, what I'm really interested in is how offending fits in with that picture, that dream.
Client: I guess it doesn't.
Therapist: Yeah, how doesn't it fit, Billy?
Client: Uh, I guess I have to keep coming-coming back here and go into court and stuff.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah. It kinda messes things up.
Therapist: Yeah. It kinda messes up that dream, that picture?
Client: Yeah. It makes it harder.
Therapist: Mm. Makes it harder? Yeah. Well, it can make it harder to keep a job, aye?
Client: Mm.
Therapist: And harder to—
Client: Like it's hard to get a job 'cause you have to say that you've done prison time and stuff, so it's pretty hard.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And we've talked about that idea of you getting a job and something to do with cars 'cause that's where your passion is.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: Yeah? So, what have you been thinking, um, since we last met, about what you might do about getting that kind of job?
Client: Uh, I don't know if-if I would go into polytech, done courses there or something.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: Yeah. Like, if they've got jobs now.
Therapist: Okay, so you know some people?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: You've gone down that road of kind of going back to school in some ways and getting a tryout or-
Client: Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: -getting a qualification?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah? So, what-what would interest you about going down that same, sort of, path?
Client: Just learn more about cars and just, kind of, hands-on job.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. Yeah, so what in particular? Like, if you could have whatever you wanted, in terms of that sort of work, what would you do?
Client: [sighs] Mechanic, or panel [unintelligible 00:18:02], or just-- I wouldn't care, I just-- as long as it's cars.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. So, as long as it has to do with cars, you'd be sweet with that?
Client: Yes, pretty much.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. So-so what sort of things do you think you need to do to go down that path to get that qualification?
Client: Just I have to get that training, I guess, and then probably get a job.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. So, what sort of training did you-- did these people, that you've been talking about, what did they do?
Client: Like, sort of, um, just at the polytech. I don't know what exactly it was, but—
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: It took them like-- And, it took them like a year or something, and then they went into apprenticeship.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah. So, how confident are you that you could do something similar to these-these friends that you've got?
Client: Yeah. I could do it pretty easy. It's just, like, I probably know all this stuff already.
Therapist: Okay. So, it would be pretty easy. So, if it's pretty easy, what do you need to do next, Billy?
Client: Like, well, I went out and picked some forms and stuff, but it's real confusing, like, having to apply, so I-I just couldn't-- I don't know. I couldn't do it.
Therapist: Okay. So, you actually went to the polytech—

Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, another thing-- Wait, what, I had something, it's just [inaudible 00:00:03] that I wanted to ask you, um, now a lot of my friends have quit smoking. They're getting like ostracized, but, you know, I tend to, like, gravitate, you know, towards-- Like my ex-husband smokes, you know-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -so I find it like acceptable in that regard.
Therapist: You bond other smokers.
Client: Mm-hmm, yeah.
Therapist: That's very common. I mean, you go where you know, um, no one's gonna look down on you.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And you're instant friends.
Client: Yeah, we share-- ""Okay, oh, a smoker, let's go out and have a smoke together,"" yeah.
Therapist: And now a total stranger will give you a cigarette-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: -whereas like, you can't go up to him and say, ""Hey, can I have some of your McDonald's French fries,"" and take them out—
Client: I like that piece of jewelry, can I? [laughs]
Therapist: Right, yeah, but with cigarettes, there is a sharing. You don't see that with any other drugs?
Client: Right. Right, yeah. You can't have my stash. [laughs]
Therapist: You can't, no, not one of mine. So, um when are you thinking you might want to do this?
Client: Um, you know, I guess I'll have to like, you know, get all of my information together.
Therapist: Okay. Do your homework.
Client: Right, do my homework and set up my like to have everything available to me.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And then maybe set up another appointment with you.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And maybe I don't know if-if that's like something that you'd be, you know, willing to do with me is to- help me set a date.
Therapist: Sure.
Client: And then you know, the next time I see, see progress, or maybe write-- have like a diary or something, I don't know.
Therapist: Okay. Yeah, no, all those things are good. I mean, I think you know, the will- picking a quit date has been found to be really effective. And, um, uh, I know you had talked earlier and then we'll end in just a couple minutes, but about, you know, like, the willingness or the readiness and most-- a lot of people, a lot of my clients have shared with me that when they woke up that morning, they truly had no idea that was going to be their last cigarette.
Client: Oh, really? So they didn't have an exact date, they just decided.
Therapist: No. Or- or some of them didn't have an exact date, but m-more importantly, was they-they just didn't know that was the day.
Client: Oh, they didn't realize-- They didn't look at the calendar.
Therapist: Right, right. It's just like you-you-you-- Some people pick a quit date, like January 1st is still the most popular quit date—
Client: And-and wait, I'm sorry, but—
Therapist: There's a smoke update coming up.
Client: Oh, yeah. [crosstalk] And you know what I've never done that.
Therapist: It's for the cancer society.
Client: That's coming up in November-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -that's cool I'll have to find out about that.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Because it's like people who will start and say, ""I'm going to stop drinking at New Year's Eve. After midnight, I'm not gonna drink.""
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: That seems to be like, uh, a false setting up, you know, like, come on.
Therapist: Actually, you would be amazed how many people do it.
Client: Really?
Therapist: Yeah, yeah, they really do, and smokers. Yeah, and drinkers, they do, yes. Yeah.
Client: Or, like, you know, setting up-- but what is that that they say? Um, you know, like, it's- it's the terminology, you know, with all the anxiety and letting go, you know, like I'm gonna [crosstalk].
Therapist: Like a new beginning.
Client: Yeah. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Yeah.
Therapist: So, for you, it's your, you know, it sounds like you really want to be prepared.
Client: Right, right.
Therapist: And yet, on some level, you know, that it's gonna be a lot of hard work for you because of, you know, you've already known how anxious you get about a stash-
Client: Right.
Therapist: So if you have a stash Nicorette gum if you decide to use it, I mean, you'd have to have other stashes, you know.
Client: Yeah, and you know, another thing, uh, uh, you know, it's so so bang, but the weight gain is like—
Therapist: That worries you?
Client: Uh-huh.
Therapist: Yeah. So, so if-if your doctor says it's okay with the Wellbutrin, one-- uh, we see very little if any weight gain-
Client: Oh, really?
Therapist: -with the Wellbutrin, yes.
Client: Oh, that's awesome, to know too.
Therapist: Yeah. And, um, the same with the Nicorette gum, because it- nicotine is an appetite suppressant.
Client: Right, right. Just like [inaudible 00:04:06] Or your chocolate and all that.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: So just switching my addiction. [laughs]
Therapist: If you will. And that's if you decide you want to try a replacement therapy and that's what we call it and it-it kind of sounds from what you've described with your fear about you know, what it would be like of the withdrawal and everything like that. W-why you don't have to do it that way, you don't have to go cold-cold turkey.
Client: Yeah, God, I don't think I could.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: You know, I mean like I said three days was like-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -three years, and all I could think about I was like obsessing about it.
Therapist: Yes. Yeah, yeah. So I think that- I think, I'm just a really big advocate of w-whatever is gonna enhance the quality and the length of your life. And if somebody becomes addicted to nicotine go- gum, God bless them. They're still gonna live longer, you know what I mean?
Client: Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: So—
Client: Yeah. That's true.
Therapist: So, we'll do that so we'll-we'll talk about the hypnosis a little bit more, you know, you'll talk to your doc. Um, you'll do your research, you know, about programs and stuff, I'll give you any information I have and we'll take it from there. But it's sounding like the quit date might be coming up fairly-- like within the next two, three months.

Therapist: I know a little bit about you from the referral letter from the doctor.
Client: From my GP?
Therapist: From your GP, yeah.
Client: Uh.
Therapist: But before we get to anything, I'll probably want to just ask you a little bit about what's led you to come here today and get a bit of an idea about what's been going on for you.
Client: What's led me to come here?
Therapist: Mm.
Client: My GP.
Therapist: And what did he have to say?
Client: Well, um, you know, I had my sort of, uh, checkup.
Therapist: mm.
Client: And it revealed that apparently, I might have diabetes 2. Well, that's what he says.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Um, I-I think that I feel perfectly well. I-I'm, you know-- I understand people with diabetes are a little bit plumper than I am.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: But, um, that's really why I'm here. I'm on his command, almost.
Therapist: Right, so he kinda gave you a directive?

Therapist: Mm.

Client: Mm, I'm very surprised.
Therapist: Mm. Came out of the blue for you?
Client: Yes. I think it did.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: And you said you kind of don't fit that kinda Type II diabetes look. That you kinda have had this idea-
Client: I-
Therapist: -you've been-been overweight with it.
Client: That's what I understand.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: You know, and I'm not overweight.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I-I sort of look after myself to a limited extent in that way. Um, but I'm a busy person, I suppose I burn off the calories. And-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I don't know, really.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: My lifestyle—
Therapist: Hmm. So it doesn't quite fit in your head, Type II diabetes and-
Client: No.
Therapist: -your lifestyle?
Client: No, not at all.
Therapist: Comes as a big surprise. And what was your reaction when he told you that at the time?
Client: Well, I-I thought he must be joking. To be honest. I thought-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -you know, why you are-- Look around you.
Therapist: Mm, mm.
Client: um, I just felt that, um-- I mean, I don't think he was wasting my time because why would he do that?
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: Right?
Therapist: He's got a lot to do.
Client: Um-- Absolutely right.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: He's got a job to do. And obviously, the tests have come through. And I have got these signs of diabetes 2.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Right? Um, I just think that-- Well, I just don't feel like it, Mark.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Um—
Therapist: So how are you feel in your head-
Client: I feel absolutely fine.
Therapist: -and what the tests say kind of like don't join up.
Client: Yeah. Well, physically, I feel absolutely fine.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I'm-I'm-- I didn't see anything wrong with me at all.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: I mean, I get around, I sleep pretty well-
Therapist: Hmm-hmm.
Client: I sort of you know-
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: - I'm-I'm compos mentis. So I don't—
Therapist: Yeah. What's the problem? Mm.
Client: What is the problem?
Therapist: And how did this happen is probably kind of what you're also thinking. Well, how did this--?
Client: Well, uh, yes. I mean-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -I must admit, I haven't done too much research. I've been a bit busy.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Um, but he-he was saying something about, I don't know, family or whatever. I don't know.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And I don't know if it's hereditary.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I think he said something about it being hereditary.
Therapist: So he mentioned, it might be a family thing. And so you-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -maybe got from your parents or something of the sort.
Client: Yeah, it could be-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -because, um, my mother mentioned-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -that, uh, my father had diabetes-
Therapist: Right.
Client: -diabetes 2. And if I think about it, um, his brother-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -uh, I haven't seen him for years.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But he might well have it because he is-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -a pretty cuddly guy. You know-
Therapist: Right.
Client: He's pretty big.
Therapist: So he fits the picture-
Client: Well, yes, the stereotype,-
Therapist: -when you think about what he-he-- Yeah, he's stereotypical.
Client: Yeah, I guess.
Therapist: A little bit bigger, perhaps doesn't look after himself that well, and he fits that foot
Client: Well, yeah. I mean, as far as I know, I hadn't seen him for-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -I don't know how many years.
Therapist: Mm. So you got this knowledge as a witness there's some family history of diabetes in the past?
Client: Apparently so. Yes, apparently so.
Therapist: Doctor mentioned that as being a factor.
Client: Mm, I mean, it is hereditary, is it?
Therapist: That's certainly true. Yes. We know that people who've had parents or have been in the past, there is a hereditary factor or genetic factor in-involved.
Client: A genetic factor. And so, does that mean that if you've got, um, if you've got a history of this within your family-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -if it's a gene-- you are more likely than not to get it?
Therapist: Correct. Yeah.
Client: Also, it's—
Therapist: But it's not inevitable.
Client: Right. Okay.
Therapist: Because its genes or the-the-the-the hereditary factor is not the only factor that causes it or is involved in it happening to you. So there's other factors that come into play.
Client: I'm sure you're going to tell me what they are.
Therapist: Well, you've-you've mentioned some of the things you know, and one of those is hereditary factors. You mentioned that the doctor mentioned that. And what else do you know or have you heard? You say you haven't had a lot of time to do the research. What else? Other things you've.
Client: To be frank, Mark, I honestly don't know. I mean, I honestly don't know what causes it because I've never had any reason. It came upon me from the GP and it took me back.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, the hereditary thing I thought, well, maybe that's the explanation.
Therapist: That makes a bit of sense.
Client: And why go any further, it's there?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Can't help it.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: They live pretty long lives, they did, all right.
Therapist: They managed with it.
Client: Relatives relatively went into their 70s.
Therapist: Okay. I don't know if it'd be helpful for you if you'd like to know a little bit more about some of the factors involved in time Type II diabetes.
Client: Well.
Therapist: If that would help.
Client: If there's something that you think that-- Yes. Yes, of course.
Therapist: Well, I'll perhaps share with you what I know from working with other people and some of the things I've experienced in working with people.
Client: Okay.
Therapist: And see what you make of it. See if it fits a little bit more with where you're at. We know that there is a strong family factor or hereditary factor, so that's one aspect. So also it tends to happen a little bit later in life, rather than something you might get when you're a teenager, this type of diabetes. So-so it's a later onset. It takes a bit of time for it to develop maybe. And the main reason I think, um, the main aspect of it is that it, have you heard about insulin.
Client: I've heard of it yeah.
Therapist: So that's a hormone or a chemical, it allows you to utilize sugar in your body.
Client: Right.
Therapist: All right. And Type II diabetes typically people have a resistance or a resistance to insulin in their cells, in their fat cells or their muscle cells or liver cells. They can't use insulin. And so sugar builds up in your system.
Client: Are you saying that they-they like they can't digest insulin or is that?
Therapist: You need insulin in your cells, individual cells in muscle or in fat or wherever to, um, use up excess sugar or to utilize sugar.
Client: Oh, I see. So-so it's like a-it's like a balance.
Therapist: That's right.
Client: So insulin you-you.
Therapist: Kind of, as your.
Client: You have yourself draws bar.
Therapist: Yap.
Client: Or something, and then what balances that out in the body is the insulin taking off the excess.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Or-or digesting? Should I say the excessive sugars?
Therapist: That's a good way to think.
Client: Is that what happened?
Therapist: Exactly. And what's happening in Type II diabetes is your-your fat cells and liver cells and muscle cells are resistant to insulin. It's almost like they're saying we can't use that.
Client: Why?
Therapist: And if-- Well, there's a number of-- We're not entirely sure, there's a lot of research still going on as to how this happens and how that could be modified. But what we do know is that, um, one of the key things in managing it is to try and modify or modulate, control the amount of sugar that are in your system.
Client: Right. Okay.
Therapist: Yeah. So there's a couple of things that we know that people with Type II diabetes have to look after and have to think about if they want to control the amount of sugar that's in their system, which is the main issue that's causing some of the health problems that people have with Type II diabetes. Too much sugar, and if it's not able to be utilized in the blood cell, in the fat cells, or liver cells, and the muscle cells stays in your bloodstream. And that can cause problems with your circulation. So too high blood sugar and too low a blood sugar can be a problem. So sugar is the main concern in Type II- Type II diabetes.And you mentioned earlier on, a couple of things that the doctor-- You've mentioned some signs that he was kind of a little bit concerned about. Well, what things did you notice over the-over the last month or so?
Client: You mean, personally?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Well, I didn't know. I mean, the thing is you see that-- I mean, I did think about this a little bit and I thought, well, over time, if things happen slowly, you don't really notice.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: As you get older.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I don't-I don't leap over five bar gates like I used to, you know, um, as opposed to, uh, running with the backs now, I tend to spend more time, you know, with my old mates in the bar.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: At the rugby club and-and-and the such like, yeah. And, um, the fish I'm hooking, I'm not after the kings anymore, I go for the snapper now, it's a bit easier, you know.
Therapist: A slightly more sedate lifestyle.
Client: Yeah, absolutely. You just do.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: You just do. Um, so you're less demanding, I guess, on your-on your body, you realize, and you don't really want to do these things anyway. You know, you let the youngsters get home.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Been there, done that. So you don't really notice. So I'm coming back to this diagnosis I had from my GP and him saying, ""You've got diabetes 2,"" well, I should feel like that, shouldn't I?
Therapist: Yeah. It should feel like there's something really wrong with you.
Client: Yeah, I mean.
Therapist: What's-how have you been feeling over the last month? So, you say you're very busy you're doing a lot of work.
Client: Yeah, I mean I'm a busy person. All right? I uh, my work uh, I work in insurance, so I'm always hopping from one place to another place.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, I haven't noticed.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: I really haven't noticed how, um, okay I get a bit--I suppose I get a bit out of breath sometimes.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: If I rush too much that-that's true. Um, I suppose, um, I don't go upstairs two at a time anymore, I use one at a time.
Therapist: So a little bit sort of energy is not quite there sometimes? The vitality.
Client: Oh, certainly the energy I have is-is not what I-what I had. I mean I do need to, you know, I'm busy but I do need to sit down, um, uh, I do need to sit down and relax with a cup of coffee, you know, and, uh, things.
Therapist: Yeah, Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, more than I would normally.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But that would be, that would be about it.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, is it getting worse? I don't know. I-I-I suppose. What worse? Is it-is it increasing? Well, to say, I don't really notice it.
Therapist: You haven't noticed it. So it's a progressive, you know, you've just seen this, as-as you got older, things have slowed down. You know those activities you used to do, but that's kind of like what happens.
Client: Yeah, yeah. Um, at least, that's what I think. I mean I don't know if you're telling me that I should be more active or my GP is saying I should be more active.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, as I say, uh, you know I-I don't do any regular form of exercise, I have to say, not anymore.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: But maybe I-maybe I don't know.
Therapist: Hmm, a bit of a mystery there.
Client: I mean I've got uh, well I-I mean I've got a great lifestyle. I mean if it's very-it-it's very good. I mean I've got all my mates in down at the rugby club. And I've got uh, you know even in the summer when that's a bit damn. I used to coach rugby and I coached cricket when I finished playing. So-so I've got the-the guys in the cricket club, um, you know, for the-for the, uh, for the summer evenings. And, uh, and then, uh, the-then, of course, we've got the fishing, and that's all of us combined. We're a big gang, really.
Therapist: Really? So what I'm hearing is there's actually a lot of aspects in your life which are really good.
Client: Oh, I think my life yeah. My life is great.
Therapist: From your perspective, things are going well?
Client: My life is great, and then you turn around and say, ""Hey you've got-- you-you're ill, you're sick.
Therapist: Yeah. It doesn't fit.
Client: And um, no I'm not. But you see, he said to me that he's gonna put me on some sort of, uh, a daily monitoring of, is it sugar levels?
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: And I'm gonna have to take regular pills.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Well frankly, the only pills I take are sort of paracetamols.
Therapist: Yeah. When you get uh, a headache.
Client: For a bit of the head in the morning, you know.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um.
Therapist: So the idea of having to test-test your blood sugar and take medications is kinda like off--
Client: Come on, you know.
Therapist: And you know that's a bit too-
Client: Well, life is too short.
Therapist: Too much.
Client: You know it's the truth.
Therapist: Yeah. Okay.
Client: I mean you know—
Therapist: And you're here today and that's probably something in you you've thought well I'll follow this through, you know I'll-I'll come along and see what-see what they've got to say. And I'm just wondering for this session, for the time we have today, there's a number of things we could talk about. You mentioned a couple of things about your lifestyle and, um, medication is one thing you've been told by the doctor you might need to do that. And a number of things that we could talk about today. Which-which area would you think would be useful for you to focus on?
Client: Well there is-there is something that you sort of prompted me to think about, and, um, I split up-- My wife and I, we split up several years ago now. And, um, you know we've been married for many many years.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: And um, I think she used to look after me because she used to do the cooking and-and-and stuff like that.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And I have to say that I'm not the best cook in the world.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, and-and being on the run all the time and you know once I get back home, it's, you know, it's time to go down to the rugby club or whatever it might be, uh, we're out with the mates. And, uh, I-I do I suppose my food is not as healthy perhaps as it used to be when she was around. She's moved down to Hamilton to live with her mother, if you've met her mother. Anyway, but, um.
Therapist: So then, since you've been on your own since you've separated, divorced and you've noticed that the things you eat and how you eat has changed.
Client: Yeah, I mean mates and their wives are pretty cool about it sometimes.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Because, you know, they'll invite me for dinner and so on.
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: And, yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess, you know, that's when you, well, or whatever reason, you split up in life.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You start looking at the home life of somebody else, you're thinking, ""Hmm, I use d to have this.""
Therapist: Hmm. Yeah, yeah.
Client: And you think, "" This is nice food, "" isn't it? and you know.
Therapist: Yeah. And your-- part of your wife used to do a lot of that for you?
Client: Oh, she would do all the cooking. Yeah, yeah,
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I never bothered to boil an egg in the water, you know.
Therapist: And so she would kinda look after what you ate and healthy things that you had, spread in front of you and off you go.
Client: Totally. I mean, I was just in charge of the wine, you know.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. And now you have to think about what you might eat and sometimes you don't eat the best.
Client: Well I-- This is what I'm saying. Maybe I'm not thinking about it. Maybe that's the thing.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Maybe I'm just—
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You know, because it-- you know this-- the pizza shop's just on the road.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And then there's-- I mean, okay, I confess that lunchtime, occasionally, it's uh, I'm hungry and McDonald's is very convenient
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -or Kentucky Fried or whatever.
Therapist: Very appealing, isn't it?
Client: You know, it's very easy. and then, um, then you think to yourself, well-- I mean, I do think of myself that maybe I should have a few vegetables around here or whatever. But then you go out into the supermarkets, you know, and you can pick up, uh, your- one of your TV dinners.
Therapist: Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm.
Client: So you bring those in and you open them up and put them in the microwave and there's vegetables there.
Therapist: Yeah they look pretty good on the plate, don't they?
Client: Yeah, it looks- it looks fine, you know, et cetera. I mean, so that will happen occasionally if I've got a night in. But cooking-wise, no, I haven't cooked anything, um, other than boil the water for the kettle for a cup o coffee.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -for ages.
Therapist: They're food choices in what you eat and what's in your diet it's not what-something you actually you've actually been aware of or had to think about in the past.
Client: Yeah. I do miss her breakfast. I have to say, we used to have get a nice breakfast.
Therapist: So one thing that you noticed is diet and the eating patterns and-
Client: Well—
Therapist: -when you eat. That's one aspect. What other aspects do you think you've-- you would be--?
Client: Well, I used to be quite a heavy smoker, right? I mean, I'd smoke a pack in a half a day. And I knew that wasn't doing me any good.
Therapist: Right.
Client: I mean the thing is when you're a-- I mean, I've always smoked. So, but when you're young and you're a sportsman, you know—
Therapist: You kinda juggle those two things and kinda--
Client: Well, the two things they balance out, you know and everybody else is
Therapist: You still run and have a cigarette?
Client: You know, you pass a cigarette down the backline almost, don't you? You know, just before the game gets—
Therapist: Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, part of the culture.
Client: Yeah, part of the of the whole thing. And it's changed a bit now, because in my day when we were playing, of course, it was a very much more of a social game, which was spent-spent in the rugby club.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: That's why you played and it was a big buddy-buddy thing.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: That was rugby and cricket was the same really.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Um, but now—
Therapist: But over the years, you've actually reduced your smoking or you've stopped altogether or at times?
Client: Well I-I, yeah. I was getting a bit sort of-- I was getting a bit, you know, a bit wheezy and I thought, ""I'll cut this out.""
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: But I enjoy smoking. I really do enjoy it. So I cut it down to I suppose it's about 10 a day now.
Therapist: Okay, so you meant to reduce.
Client: Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: You were noticing that it's having an impact on your breathing and health wasn't so good.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: When you related that to your smoking, so you managed to reduce your smoking.
Client: Yeah, yeah. I sort of—
Therapist: So you've made our decision to do that?
Client: it-it-it's-- you know, she will, ""Why don't you give up? You've gone so far, why don't you just stop?"" But I don't want to.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: It's-it's-- I-I enjoy it, um—
Therapist: Yeah, and it's hard to get to stop something you enjoy, isn't it?
Client: Well, yeah. I mean, you know, the thing is that you get to, you know, you've got to-- when you get down to that, you, uh, you have to regulate sort of-
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You know, you have to be quite strong-willed about, I suppose, in a way.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: So you say, ""Okay, well, you don't have a cigarette unless you have a cup of coffee. [laughs]
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know.
Therapist: But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?
Client: Oh, yeah, yeah. I have two sugars. A couple of sugar in coffee. Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: So we cut that down as I say.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: But the problem goes that coffee, we're up to 8 or so, 10 cups of coffee a day now.
Therapist: You're drinking more coffee. So what I've heard you say so far is, if I can just start right back from the beginning and you used to come in and sais, ""I went to the doctor."" You went for-- it sounds like you went for just a checkup.
Client: No, you know, there's a friend of mine, one of the guys down the rugby club, he said- he said, ""I'm going for my annual, you know-
Therapist: MIT.
Client: -warranty of fitness, sort of thing, you know. And I thought, now that's an idea, not been to one of those.
Therapist: Got to check out, why not?
Client: So I'm 55, and you read in the papers, you know, it's that at 55 you will-- you know, heart disease is more prevalent
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: -and all these sorts of things that you get around this middle-age time. So I thought, ""Well, I'll go and have one."" And frankly, when I went along, I was very confident. I thought, you know, the doctor is going to saying, ""Hmm, I wish I was as healthy as you,"" sort of thing.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, but unfortunately, uh, he-he came up with this. And it's the only thing I think he really came up with. I think-
Therapist: So everything else looked pretty good?
Client: My cholesterol is quite good, not too bad.
Therapist: Cholesterol good, your weight is good.
Client: Yeah-yeah. Not too bad.
Therapist: Um, you are smoking, but you've managed to reduce that.
Client: Well, yeah, I've cut it down, yeah. I mean, that's been three years, mind.
Therapist: And anything else, you know, you go ticking down the list. The tire is good, oil good.
Client: Absolutely.
Therapist: So we're looking good.
Client: And then we come to this-
Therapist: And ah, hang on.
Client: -too much sugar in the tank, or something. I don't know.
Therapist: Yeah, there's something wrong with the, uh, with this bit.
Client: So, yeah.
Therapist: And it doesn't quite fit with how you see your own lifestyle.
Client: No.
Therapist: Because you've-- it sounds like what you've been doing, you've made some conscious effort to be aware of some of those things you might think are important.
Client: I mean, yeah. I mean, you know, the thing is, you see, the thing is, and I mean, and probably you've-- I think you've heard this before, but people, they turn around, oh, uh, you know, doom and gloom prophets, you shouldn't drink.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: You shouldn't smoke.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And then I think to myself, ""Well, maybe I shouldn't socialize."" And then after that, ""Well, maybe I shouldn't be alive.""
Therapist: So like a domino effect, and they'll all be just sitting-
Client: You know. I mean, what-what-what's going on here? This is- this is- this is so many people's lives.
Therapist: Mm-hm.
Client: And um, I suppose, you know, if it came down to it, then, and somebody said, ""Well, you can solve this problem by taking a pill once a day, um, you know, it will keep it down, and there will be no problems,"" Then I-I could go with that. But what I don't want to do, um, the doctor was saying, or insinuating, that I'd have to change my lifestyle.
Therapist: A bit broad kind of like you've gotta change everything.
Client: Yeah. It was um, and I-I said, well, no. I'm sorry. [coughs] I'm not going to change my lifestyle. I've got to where I am. I'm reasonably happy. Okay, I wish I wasn't separated. Okay, I wish my kids were-were still around, um, you know. One of them is off now in, um, in-- back in Europe playing rugby in France.
Therapist: Yeah. And your thought was, yeah, right, I hear that, but actually, I don't want to make all these big changes in my life.
Client: No, I don't want to, because I don't feel that I need to.
Therapist: Feel like you need to. Yeah.
Client: I mean, it's you know, why?
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Um, I can't argue with a medical professional, Mark, because I know nothing, you know.
Therapist: The test, is the test, and experience, yeah.
Client: So, I mean, what-what-what-what suggestions would you have? I mean, what-what sort of-
Therapist: I don't know. I think it's up to you where we start, and that's the question I've got in my mind. You've mentioned a couple of things that you've already made some effort, or been conscious of. You've mentioned the diet, you've mentioned your smoking, those are two quite important aspects that we often talk about here in how people work.
Client: Is smoking related to diabetes then?
Therapist: It can have an impact, yes. So smoking, um, affects your blood system, so it hardens the arteries, um, and over time, it can have a significant impact on the healing of wounds. So people with Type II diabetes, often, if they get a cut, or a bruise, or something, it takes a long time to heal. Smoking reduces the amount of oxygen in your system, so that can further, you know, limit the time it takes your body to heal.
Client: Oh.
Therapist: So we know that smoking and Type II diabetes together-
Client: Don't help.
Therapist: -isn't a good combination.
Client: Is it okay if you have one without the other? I'm sorry, it's a silly question. [laughs]
Therapist: Well, the question is, I suppose, that I have for you is, where would you think, for you, would be a good place to start? If you were gonna make any changes, even small changes at the beginning, rather than just thinking, oh, I got to change everything, which it sounds like you're not prepared to, you know, do a whole lifestyle change, and I don't think that's what we're talking about here. Where would you feel most comfortable to start if you were gonna make any changes at all?
Client: Where would I start? Well, I-- What if about if I cut down on sugar in the coffee? If we could have long blacks, no milk, and no sugar.
Therapist: Yeah. Hmm, that might be a start.
Client: I think I could- I think I could probably handle that.
Therapist: Hm. What we also find is that people make these little changes, small changes, and that starts to kind of well, it makes them-
Client: Something of a rollover effect.
Therapist: -rollover, the domino effect starts to happen, and they start looking at other aspects.
Client: Domino effect, yeah.
Therapist: So rather than thinking, ""oh, my God, I have to change all these things. I've gotta stop smoking, I've gotta exercise more, I've gotta, you know, start eating more fruit and vegetables,"" you might start with these small changes, and then-
Client: I mean, how much exercise should I do a week?
Therapist: Um, I-I'm reluctant to give a prescription for that because I think it's really up to you. And I think it depends on how things go, as to how much you need to do.
Client: Right.
Therapist: You mentioned earlier on, the doctors talking about you monitoring your blood sugar.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So on how-- It depends on how-how that goes. Let's say, if you started doing that and you do some more exercise, you start to have longer blacks, rather than short blacks with lots of sugar. And you get down the sugar and you find your blood sugar starts to come down, then we're heading in the right direction.
Client: Okay, so—
Therapist: So it's really, I suppose, up to how things go for you, and you get that feedback. And if that's going in the right direction, you carry on doing and do some more of that.
Client: So, a-are we saying then that-that, really all I need to do, for this moment, is I can forget about everything, but cut out the sugar, uh, in the coffee and the milk-- I don't know, but you might as well, you know, milk without sugar is silly. But, um, if we do that, is that where we start?
Therapist: I think where we start is where you feel comfortable starting.
Client: Well, I mean that's something that's not difficult to do.
Therapist: Apples for breakfast.
Client: You start off at breakfast and get yourself an apple, a bit-a bit of apple and-and so on. Um—
Therapist: So what I'm hearing you're kind of saying is, that there's-- You're now starting to think of some very useful little starting points.
Client: Maybe.
Therapist: Not huge changes, but some little things you could do.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And it's kind of dawning on you there may be some possibilities here for making some changes. Let me ask you this. Um, let's say you put some of these things in place and you start to make some of these small changes.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Um, where do you see that taking you in the next set of three, four, five years? You know, where do you want to be in three to four years' time? What would be your ideal picture?
Client: Well, you know, and this is difficult because I don't feel unhealthy now.
Therapist: No.
Client: So, I suppose it would be fun to-- Maybe I should join a club or two, that's what I'm thinking because I'll be with mates.
Therapist: Yeah? You like the social aspect?
Client: I love the social aspect of it, and, um, there's-there's-- I know there's a bar in this club as well. I-- Don't-don't misunderstand me, I don't drink-
Therapist: No, no, I get that. I get that.
Client: -till-- You know, I'm not an alcoholic or anything like that, I—
Therapist: So part of that whole keeping fit and exercise stuff is actually the social side of it, isn't it?
Client: So yeah, so to get that balance, and maybe that's what I'm actually missing in life, and maybe this is, um-- I mean yes I do get up in the morning sometimes, and I suppose I do feel a bit—
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: You know? Even after a decent night's sleep, you know?
Therapist: Haven't quite that-
Client: And you need-- I'm getting this cup of coffee and maybe I'm—
Therapist: And the coffee helps a little bit because it perks you up?
Client: And that gets me going. Yeah.
Therapist: And the sugar in it helps too.
Client: Yeah, the sugar gives me the boost, I suppose. I-it's fantastic.
Therapist: So what I'm hearing is that your life, your work, your routines are-- Sometimes you're driving or you've got to keep awake, get up in the morning sometimes and you haven't quite got that buzz or the energy. You need a shot, and then throughout the day you might need just more shots to keep that energy up.
Client: Hmm. If I give up sugar in my coffee, give up the milk, black coffees, right?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: if I find some social form of exercise, like squash.
Therapist: And an activity which has got a starting to finish and it's something you do for a slot.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And then there's maybe some social aspects to it as well.
Client: Yeah, and then—
Therapist: You can see some benefits and some enjoyment that.
Client: And then, you know, give this, say, six months, I don't know what period it would be, then go back to the GP and say, ""Test me again.""
Therapist: That sounds like a great plan.
Client: And so maybe that would, uh—
Therapist: Yeah, sounds like a good idea.
Client: Maybe it's an idea. I mean—
Therapist: I think anything you do, it has to be something you've decided. You know, just start where you want to start. You've mentioned some really good ideas about possibly getting a little bit more exercise into your life, doing something like squash or something of that nature. You've mentioned some really good ideas about reducing the amount of sugar you-you-you're-you're intaking during the day, and coffee is a good place to start. Having an apple for breakfast, I think you mentioned that, a bit of fruit.
Client: Yeah, like my wife used to. Yeah.
Therapist: Those are some really good ideas and good starting points. So thinking about it like that, what-- Where are you now? What's your-- What-what-- Where-where is your thinking now?
Client: Well, you see, I mean, I'm thinking, ""Actually it might not be a bad idea this,"" because [chuckles] it would mean I could socialize harder, couldn't I? No, no I'm just joking. Uh, but, um, yeah, I mean, why not? Why not? Why not? It might be fun, it's a new path.
Therapist: What's to lose? What's to gain?
Client: Well, it would appear that there is something to gain, and-- I mean, I-- What do I lose? I don't know until I do it. But I'm thinking that if I do it and I do what I'm enjoying doing, I won't miss what I'm not doing. Does that make sense?
Therapist: It does make sense, yeah.
Client: Um, yeah I don't mind. I-- It's not a—
Therapist: So when you look at it, there's probably more to gain from making these changes than there is to lose.
Client: I'll talk to Billy about, um-- Billy is, um, he's the gym bloke.
Therapist: Right.
Client: I'll have a word with him because I'm due down the club tonight.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Really.
Therapist: So you've got to work these things on your mind. You know, the-- And workout where's the place to start.
Client: Yeah, I think that you say where-where you're at now, where you're going, where—
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -and-and-and this is what I've got to do. I think I'm in a rut. I think that's where I've—
Therapist: You've been stuck?
Client: I'm-I'm just-- I'm-I'm satisfiedly sort of contented, uh, sitting in this- in this rut and, um, that my doctor has actually di-diagnosed me with diabetes 2-
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: -which he says can be managed, and you seem to be insinuating that it can be managed.
Therapist: Indeed, yeah.
Client: Uh, maybe this is a blessing, actually-
Therapist: So rather than--
Client: -because I think to myself, ""Well, if someday, I am diagnosed with diabetes, I'd just carry on and-""
Therapist: Carrying on.
Client: ""-sitting in the corner of the bar, and chat, and talk and probably get fat."" I don't know, and make it worse. And, yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.
Therapist: So it's been a bit of a-a bit of a shock, but now you kinda reflect on it.
Client: Yeah, that's cool.
Therapist: Maybe this is the-
Client: That's really cool.
Therapist: -bit of a shake that I needed, you know, just sort of remind me. I might feel okay. I might-- From my perspective, your perspective, you're thinking, ""Well, what's the problem? Everything's fine.""
Client: Mm.
Therapist: But now you seem to be thinking looking and thinking, ""Maybe things weren't, or aren't, as good as I thought they were.""
Client: Yeah, I mean, I think you're quite right. I think you just—
Therapist: Things could be better?
Client: I don't know, you become sedentary, don't you? No, it seems that-- No, actually, this is quite exciting. It quite [unintelligible 00:31:28]
Therapist: Yeah, I sense that. I sense that in you that you're--
Client: I think to myself, I think, ""Oh,"" I think go—
Therapist: Quite invigorated with the idea of--
Client: Yeah. I mean, this is- this is- this is cool, it's like an old challenge again.
Therapist: Making some of these changes. Yeah.
Client: This is good. And, um—
Therapist: You're up for the challenge?
Client: I think I am. I mean, I never thought about it, but when I think about it now it's, ""What am I doing here?"" Why am I like this? Why am I just happy contented to drift?
Therapist: So think about when you were-- This-this is an interesting question to see what you think. You were- you were a coach. You-- Maybe you'll be a coach again.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: What would you say if you were talking to yourself, if you like, you know, if you were the coach saying, ""Right--""
Client: Oh, so if I was obs- if I was sort of-
Therapist: Yeah, what-what would you be saying?
Client: -observing as it were?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Watching myself, what would I say? I-I-- Well, I would say, you know, are you happy?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: That-- Are you contented with that performance of you and your team?
Therapist: And, I suppose, our own personalized a little bit like that, there's lots of different aspects that need to be tweaked.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Modified and looked at, to get the best out of ourselves, to get the best out of the opportunities we have.
Client: I think you're- I think you're right. I think, um-- And again, you put them together and it's-it's-it's becoming-- It's-it's a sort of a-an individual team job, isn't it really?
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: That, okay, do a bit of this and do a bit of that.
Therapist: Some good things I'm- some things I'm good at and there are some other aspects we think, ""Well--""
Client: Yeah, but I don't have to give up anything really, do I?
Therapist: It's not about giving up your personality or-
Client: No.
Therapist: -changing who you are fundamentally.
Client: No it's not. It's not.
Therapist: It's just tweaking things. Just fine-tuning a few areas and being a bit more aw-aware of one aspect of your life a bit more, like the food choices or whatever. Well, Mike, I-I've really enjoyed listening to your perspective, and your story a little bit, and it's helped me a lot to get an idea about where you're coming from, and a little bit about who you are, and what's happened in your past. And-and we've also talked a bit about what's going to happen next. And you've come up with some great ideas. What I hear you saying is that, you know, before all this, before you met the GP, things are going fine.Well, as you would of-- As, you know, as you'd seen it, you were just doing your thing, and getting on working, and being busy, and being successful, and then suddenly this diagnosis, this doctor tells you that you've got a problem.
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: It comes along to me and talk today a bit about how you felt about that. Initially, it can be quite a bit of a-bit of a shock. It didn't quite fit with how you saw things.
Client: True, true.
Therapist: And as we've been talking, I'm hearing you're saying that maybe if you look back to where you were before you went to the doctor, things weren't quite that right, maybe. Things weren't as good as you thought they were.
Client: Now that I think about it- now that I think about it, maybe.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Maybe they were.
Therapist: And what I also hear you saying, it's possibly the-- It's now possibly more possible, in your mind, that you could make some of these changes, rather than bring broad-brush, you know, huge changes to your lifestyles. It's not about changing who you are, it's not changing huge facets of your life, but maybe small steps that need to be taken.
Client: Yeah, you see—
Therapist: What you're kind of thinking about what those might.
Client: Mm. When your life comes to a halt-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -your family splits up, or whatever, and you don't have anymore, I-I think you stop caring really. Uh, y-you know, you stop caring about yourself
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Because everything is just f-
Therapist: Nobody there too.
Client: Nobody there, [crosstalk] it's true and so,-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -you know,-
Therapist: Mhm.
Client: -you don't care.
Therapist: So now it's time-
Client: So that's maybe [crosstalk]
Therapist: -to think about looking after yourself a bit more.
Client: Maybe, a bit selfish but maybe why not?
Therapist: Why not?
Client: Why not? Yeah, that's a good idea.
Therapist: Yeah. So, we've run out of time but I also want to ask you a final question, where to from here, what's next?
Client: Oh right, well, wha-what we talked about. Now, you know, uh, okay, uh, coffee. Right? No sugar.
Therapist: You'll start with that?

Client: Um, I'm just- yeah I just like to have a few drinks.

Therapist: Well, you know, what, I-- There are a lot of people that wouldn't disagree with you on that exactly. You know, so, um, uh, but I know that they-they were never quite sure how they were all interacting all together. Like the, um- the weed kind of tends to make people a little paranoid anyway.
Client: Yeah, I-I-I got to be careful with it. If I take more than a hit or two of it, it-it-it can be a bit of a problem.

Client: That's a good way to sum it up. And it's-- Well, you understand it, uh, it's just- it's not good.

Client: Well, my wife is making me be here today. Uh, she thinks that it's a problem that I'm smoking weed, so she said, ""You need to go and get some help.""
Therapist: Okay. Um, so you said that your wife said it's a problem. Um, so do you not feel like it's a problem for you?
Client: No, I don't think it's a problem at all. It's something I do to help me relax. In fact, I think it's something that is good for me, but—
Therapist: Okay. Can you tell me a little bit more about how, like, it's-it's not an issue for you?
Client: Yeah. You know, like I said, you know, I'll come home, I'll, you know, smoke a couple rolls after a long day or something. I'm able to just relax, not really think about things. You know what I mean? I'm still working and, you know, paying the bills. We have a house, so I don't- I don't know why it's a problem.
Therapist: Okay. Um, is it causing any problems in areas like your marriage or anything like that?
Client: I mean, I guess a little bit, you know, like-- I mean, she's the one that-that has me being here. We've been fighting about it, you know. Uh, uh, I don't know, I-I guess I'm-I'm getting pretty frustrated with her. She just won't get off my back about it. So I finally said, ""Fine, I'll go see someone.""
Therapist: Okay. Um, so are you here to maybe work on your marriage? Is that an area that you are wanting to-to work on?
Client: Uh, I mean, I'm just here because she said that I need to be in here. So, I mean, yeah, I wanna save my marriage, you know.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: And, I mean, I love her, you know, but I'm here because she's making me be here.

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: Thanks for coming in today. I guess you've, uh, sat in that seat with lots of people like me in the past.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: Yeah. And you have some ideas about that and some experiences about that. So today I wanna- be good for us to talk about that and, um, I'm really interested to know what you've been thinking about in terms of what you may wanna change in your life 'cause we're gonna be working together for a while here.
Client: Right. Neat. What, um, what have I changed, what am I—
Therapist: What you've been thinking about, um, over the last little while about getting your life back on track. 'Cause I noticed you've—
Client: I've been thinking about how easy it would be to deal P again.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I've been thinking about, um, how I could actually set myself up the right way doing it the wrong way.
Therapist: Sure. So what I'm picking up is-is that-that-that's a life that you know a lot about.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: And you can make lots of money and set yourself up well. What's the other side, because I guess when I talk to guys like yourself who have done time, often they're thinking about actually, mm, maybe life can be with different. So I'm wondering where-where you're at with the kind of thinking about—
Client: Well, at the end of, you know, that last week inside, I was- I had that kind of, okay, what's next buzz? And, you know, it just doesn't work out here.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: I don't have a, uh, uh, I don't know what that is.
Therapist: Sure. So life on the outside is pretty different than the kind of-
Client: Yes.
Therapist: -the expectation of life on the inside something?
Client: Yeah, it's worse.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So tell me how you've been managing. 'Cause I don't know if you'd been back dealing? How have you been managing to-to-to—
Client: I haven't yet, I mean-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -the, uh, the offer's there.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Um, I don't know why I haven't said that I will yet but I mean-
Therapist: Uh, tell me-
Client: -it's there.
Therapist: It's there and-and-and you've a lot of contacts?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: You've been in the system, so lots of context. So this isn't a new challenge for you.
Client: No.
Therapist: So what stopped you over the last-- How long have you been out now?
Client: How long have I been out?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Three weeks, one day.
Therapist: Three weeks, isn't it?
Client: Three weeks, one day.
Therapist: So what's been there? What's it about that you haven't done in three weeks one day?
Client: I don't know.
Therapist: 22 days you've actually made a decision not to-to pick up your old life and continue on.
Client: Um, I'd- I- you know, I kind of told myself not to, you know, just before I left. And then I'm just kind of with it and I don't quite know why. [clears throat] I dunno, if, uh, there's no real reason why I haven't yet. It's just that I don't- I just don't think it'll work the way I always dream it will you know, I see myself up like, whatever, if I do that again, the next leg is a long one. A real long one.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And I-I can't go back there. There's no way I'm going back there.
Therapist: Right. So the one hand you've-you-you could sit yourself up and-and take the risk, but on the other hand, you know, that actually it might not last?
Client: No, never lasts.
Therapist: Never lasts. Mm. You seem like a bit of a crossroads to me.
Client: Yep. I've been in crossroads for 12 years.
Therapist: Mm. But there've been times when those crossroads would be more sort of focused than other times.
Client: Yeah. And- [crosstalk]
Therapist: Yeah. And it sounds like maybe like-
Client: -sort of opposite, yeah.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: You know, we're in the middle, you know, and it's actually at the moment, I guess.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But I don't know. You know, that's quite clear that no fucking idea.
Therapist: Okay. Okay. So—
Client: Do you have an idea?
Therapist: No. Well, I've-I've got lots of ideas, but I'm really interested to hearing your ideas kind of first though because you know, and there might be some things that we can work on.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: But I guess what I'm really interested in is-is you've made a commitment 22 days, drug-free. Haven't gone back into that lifestyle. What-what's keeping you, 'cause you're at the crossroads, you kind of just pause there at the moment. I'm not sure about this other bit over here. What keeping you in that place?
Client: Fiona?
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Tell me about Fiona?
Client: She's told me that it's over if I do it. You know, I mean, she-- What tell you about, Fiona I mean she's been with me. She's the one who stayed through all the shit. And I owe her-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -something.
Therapist: Okay. So you've been with Fiona for how long?
Client: 12 years.
Therapist: 12 years. Okay. So she's stood by you then for the time, [crosstalk] but this time she said, it happens again I'm out of here?
Client: Yeah. She's actually got the black and white line down now.
Therapist: Okay. And it sounds like you're listening to that black and white line.
Client: It's pretty she- you know, she could be pretty full-on.
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: Yeah, so it's hard to ignore that line.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean. And it comes with a whole lot of different rules, and you know, she's never been quite like she is now.
Therapist: Okay. So something's changed in your relationship between you, yeah?
Client: Yeah. I think she has. I don't think I have.
Therapist: Okay. So what's Fiona want you from you?
Client: She just wants me. I mean, she just wants someone to be there. Me. She-she remembers me and she wants- she wants him.
Therapist: She wants him. So which him does she want, Daryl?
Client: The one that, you know—
Therapist: Does she want the- did she want the-the him that she fell in love with and saw great things in?
Client: Yeah, that's the one.
Therapist: Or does she want the-the-the-the him that's- that keeps on getting into trouble?
Client: No, no. No one would want him. I don't want him. He's a fuckwit, right? She wants the one that she fell in love with.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So what's it gonna take to reclaim this Daryl that she fell in love with?
Client: If I had the answer to that, I wouldn't need to be sitting here.
Therapist: Sure, yeah.
Client: And I mean, I honest- I don't know, man. I don't know. I-I wish I knew somewhere I could start that, you know, could give it to her, but I-I can't. I-I don't know.
Therapist: All right. Well, let's-let's just play with this idea a little bit, Daryl. So what did Fiona fall in love with? What were the qualities of Daryl that she said, ""This is him""?
Client: I was pretty romantic. I mean, I was pretty quite smooth, and, um, you know, I was on top of my game, like, she- and she loved it. And we used to laugh in the [unintelligible 00:06:45], you know? And just- it was always really sweet, and people used to say, ""Oh, man, you two. You two have just got it,"" you know? And we lost it, so whatever that was, that's what she wants. We were young. How do you become young? Uh, you know, I'm old, and we'll keep growing old, but you know?
Therapist: I know.
Client: Like if I'm not careful, I will be.
Therapist: Sure. Everyone will age, but that will happen on time.
Client: Yeah, certainly.
Therapist: Um, but that's okay. So-so it's she fell in love with this, the sense of fun, the sense of Daryl, and things have changed, but she's still with you?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah. And you're still with her?
Client: Yeah, yep.
Therapist: Yeah. So catch me up with the conversations you've had with Fiona about this crossroads you're at. You know, these 22 days, you haven't gone back, you've coming out and you're not back? You could pick up this dealing quite easily and probably some workout here tomorrow and get back into it.
Client: You know what? She hasn't even talked about the dealing, like, she won't even broach that subject. That's how black and white she is. She's- she'll be- she offers suggestions, you know? What I could do, and- or I kind of go with that, but none of them are-- You know, it's lovely that she's really finding things, but they're not the things. I mean, it-- I started kind of placating her and making it okay to keep giving me suggestions, but like, I need to come up with something because it's like awesome love, but you know, not in love, and she's getting sick of it already.
Therapist: Okay. All right. So-so back together, things are starting to get tense at home, and your relationship a little bit?
Client: A little bit that. Yeah, little-little bit tense. Yeah, that's fair.
Therapist: Yeah. Don't put words in your mouth. I'm sure if that is—
Client: No, they are.
Therapist: Oh, yeah? Yeah?
Client: I mean, not like they have been because we've only just started on the new road, but I mean, yeah, tense is the right word.
Therapist: Second, I'd like to talk, Daryl, about this all- whole idea, that's this crossroads idea, yep? So on the one hand here, you've got this 12 year history of being in the other system and done some time and being away from Fiona, but you're now back, sitting back together, and you've got some choice about where to go. So, in that 'where to go', what ideas have you been thinking about in terms of where this-this Daryl, non-dealing [crosstalk] guy—
Client: Well, I don't know. I haven't got little, um, nuggets of where I could go. I've just got like this feeling that I should go somewhere.
Therapist: Okay. Yep. So a part of you knows you need to go something different, but the direction doesn't seem to be that clear at the moment?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: It [unintelligible 00:09:33] picking up?
Client: Yeah. No idea.
Therapist: No idea. Okay. So I'm wondering, you've been in the system a while. You're now 34, is it right from the pick-up?
Client: [nods].
Therapist: Yeah. So, you know, often at 34, guys start to think about being with a girl in their life and what's important. And-and you would have also been part- not as a guy, so they've actually made some shifts and changes and thought, ""Time to move on"".
Client: Yeah. Well, um—
Therapist: And now you've got—
Client: Not many.
Therapist: Not many?
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: But some.
Client: Um, oh, I've got. Yeah, one. [chuckles]
Therapist: One?
Client: One.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Mm, yeah.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Okay, so, um—
Therapist: Tell me something about that.
Client: Well, he-he was- he was inside with me the first time I was ever inside, and now he's a drug counselor.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: So, he's the- he did it.
Therapist: He did it?
Client: I don't know how the fuck he did that, but, 'cause because he wasn't even a real addict, he was just-- Well, I mean, I don't know. He's very good with people.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Really good at talking, and, uh, but anyway, I don't know how he did it.
Therapist: Cool. So how interested would you be to find out more information about how he did it? 'Cause I'm thinking about this is someone who you know, you've done time with, got a relationship.
Client: Yeah, but I can't ever be a drug counselor.
Therapist: No, I'm not suggesting you-- No, not about being a drug counselor, but about he made that transition from-from being involved in crime-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -to a transition about being in a different place.
Client: Yeah. I think he would have found some higher power. They find-- I'm not gonna find one of them.
Therapist: Okay, no 12-step higher power idea?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So that might work for him, but what might work for you?
Client: I don't know. That's why I'm here.
Therapist: Sure.
Client: I don't know what that is.
Therapist: Okay, so part of being here with me, and the work we might do, will be to find- try and find- search for that-
Client: Okay.
Therapist: -thing. Whatever it is.
Client: Good luck.
Therapist: Well, it's a search, isn't it?
Client: Yeah, I don't mean to be rude-
Therapist: No.
Client: -but I do mean it's a big ask.
Therapist: Yep, it is a big ask. So what qualities would you need to have to-to go there?
Client: Fucking guts.
Therapist: Guts? Yeah?
Client: Is it a quality?
Therapist: I think it is.
Client: Yeah, I'd need some of them.
Therapist: Yeah? So you're the sort of guy, Daryl, with guts?
Client: Am I?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: No, not yet.
Therapist: Not yet?
Client: Well, no I'm not.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: No, I don't have that-that-that much courage.\
Therapist: Yet you're sitting here with me today-
Client: Oh, I have to.
Therapist: -and-and-and you're talking about stuff.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Well, you're sitting here, and you're talking with me-
Client: Oh, okay.
Therapist: -about stuff that's-that's quite deep-

Return ""simple"", ""complex"" or ""none"" based on whether the last therapist's utterance  has a simple, complex or no reflection. 
Feel free to return none as the therapist utterance might not have any reflection.

Here are a few examples.

Examples:

Example 1
Client: But-but the wheezing is something that I've definitely noticed a little bit.
Therapist: I guess I also wonder whether, regardless of-of if your asthma symptoms are connected to Oscar, that may be part of you feels like it's worth it because he's been-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: -such a big part of your life for so long.
Answer: complex

Example 2
Client: Um, I'm just- yeah I just like to have a few drinks. I mean, you know, obviously, I-I have, uh, this diagnosed condition, and-and I think, you know, if I were able to, you know, maybe take a few hits off of the joint and have a couple of beers, I think that's about the same as taking the medicine.
Therapist: Well, you know, what, I-- There are a lot of people that wouldn't disagree with you on that exactly. You know, so, um, uh, but I know that they-they were never quite sure how they were all interacting all together. Like the, um- the weed kind of tends to make people a little paranoid anyway.
Client: Yeah, I-I-I got to be careful with it. If I take more than a hit or two of it, it-it-it can be a bit of a problem.
Therapist: Yeah. Why, what happens if you take a little too much of it?
Answer: none

Example 3
Client: That's a good way to sum it up. And it's-- Well, you understand it, uh, it's just- it's not good.
Therapist: Mm. So, and then you said, you don't like how it makes you act, um, if you can tell me a little bit about that.
Answer: simple

Example 4
Client: Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know.
Therapist: But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?
Answer: complex

Example 5
Client: I wanna stay friends with them. I don't want- I don't want them to just-
Therapist: You don't wanna lose your support group, yeah. You just wanna them to support you in being healthy, while helping them, raising the babe, and so we're just taking path B. You don't wanna lose them, just maybe the lifestyle it sounds like.
Answer: none

Example 6
Client: Um, I mean, I guess- I guess I need some strategies for figuring out how to ease stress without, I guess, getting high.
Therapist: Okay. And that's a very good reason for being here. Um, can you talk to me about maybe some of your-- the goals that you have?
Answer: none

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: Thank you for coming in to see me today, Nina. I'm looking forward to getting to know you a little bit and hearing a little bit about you and what brought you in here today.
Client: Um, my doctor referred me. He said I had to come because I've- I've been a little irresponsible with this pregnancy. Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. He's thinking you were a little irresponsible.
Client: Yeah. Um, he said that I was drinking too much with it. Um, I-I haven't been a lot, but he said it was still maybe, um, would screw things up.
Therapist: And you're feeling kind of concerned about that.
Client: Yeah. Yeah. Like I don't- I don't want to screw anything up with this baby, but, um, yeah, I'm just- I'm scared I already did.
Therapist: Okay. So, you're concerned about the consequences, and you really care about your baby, and you want to give your baby the best start you can.
Client: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Therapist: And you're wondering a little bit about this time that we're going to spend together.
Client: Yeah. He didn't really tell me what to expect. He just said, ""Go- go see her as well.""
Therapist: So here you are today and, um, you're sharing that you have been drinking alcohol throughout your pregnancy.
Client: Yeah. Um, I didn't find out I was pregnant until probably two-ish months in-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -and I had already been drinking then. Um, I've been really trying not to, but, you know, weekends come around, and, um, all my friends are kind of partying and stuff, and it's been hard to, like, break that habit.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. So, there's this external pressure coming from the people you care about to sort of stay in the scene.
Client: A little bit. I think if I- if I talk to them, it would be fine, but it's-it's weird, right? Like I'm the only one of my friends that's, like, taking this step and having a kid, and they don't really know how to handle that.
Therapist: Kind of feels like You're between two worlds. In one world, you're preparing to be a mother and bring a baby into this world, and this other world is the world that you've been in for a while where you're kind of having a good time and-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -drinking and your friends are-
Client: Yeah, like, I'm- I'm still, like, I'm only in my 20s, and-and for everyone else, it's like, ""Okay, it's party time,"" and now I kind of have to, like, break out of that.
Therapist: Okay. So, this party-time world's- are you feeling like this is something you want to move out of and move into that mom world? Or does it feel like I want to hang out there still too?
Client: There's, yeah, there's part of me that still wants to live that out because I'm not going to have another chance, like once this kid comes, it's-it's going to be over. I know I'm gonna- I know I'm going to have to change.
Therapist: So, for you, you're feeling like once the baby comes and actually in your arms, then things are going to change, but right now, while you're pregnant, you're thinking, ""I can kind of hang out in both worlds a little bit,"" but part of you may be thinking maybe that's not the case. It's time to go to the mom world maybe.
Client: Yeah. Probably. And I'm also feeling like it's too late. I already screwed it up.
Therapist: Okay. So, you've got a lot of concerns about what's happened to- up until this point, as far as your drinking. What do you know about, um, drinking alcohol throughout pregnancy?
Client: Well, I know, like, they say not to, but I thought because my friends didn't really care, I thought, ""Okay. Like maybe-maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe it's just what they tell you."" Just like drinking, in general, is bad.
Therapist: So, you were thinking because your-your friends weren't pressuring you to stop drinking, that-that it must be okay.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And then there's this other part of you that's- was thinking maybe it's not okay.
Client: Yeah, like, I should probably have trusted my gut.
Therapist: So, your gut is telling you what? Tell me about that.
Client: It's telling me that what I'm doing is wrong and it's probably hurting my kid and that- that I'm gonna really regret that once I actually get my kid.
Therapist: And you really wanna do what's best for your babe. And kind of wondering, um, how to move forward from here, is that where you wanna, you know, kind of focus in on, or what are your thoughts about giving up drinking altogether?
Client: Um, I'm definitely it's not-- I think I could probably do it. It's just- it-it comes hard when you're, like, in that moment. You're around your friends and they're drinking and you don't wanna be- you don't wanna be the mom at that moment. You wanna be yourself. You wanna be who you were before.
Therapist: So, you kind of have this identity, dual identity going on. I wanna be that person, yet, that person-
Client: And so many people, when they have kids, they just vanish from their friends. And I don't wanna be that person. I don't wanna be that person that just has a kid and they're completely-completely different.
Therapist: Mm. So, embraces this life of the picket fence and the, you know, the little house and having the baby in this-
Client: Yeah, suburbs. Yeah.
Therapist: So, you don't wanna be that- that- that woman that's just sort of living in this house with the baby carriage, and at the same time, that world's kind of saying it's behind you.
Client: Yeah, I-I guess. Like, I don't wanna- I don't wanna lose my friends because of this. And I don't wanna put pressure on them to change because they're, I mean, they're good people. They're just—
Therapist: You care about them.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: It's just the scene that they're-they're still in because their life maybe hasn't taken that change that your life has made. And so now, you're here and you're not sure. You want the baby, but you're not sure about the suburbs and the picket fence thing. You're not sure—
Client: I don’t want that.
Therapist: You don't want that.
Client: No.
Therapist: You want this baby.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And you wanna be, um, take care of your baby as the baby's growing.
Client: Like, I wanna- I wanna be responsible for this thing.
Therapist: You don't wanna let your baby down.
Client: No.
Therapist: And at the same time, it's hard to let go of the past, but on the other hand, you're thinking, ""I don't have a choice. I've got to look this way."" Is that kind of what it feels like?
Client: I guess so. I feel like I've already made a choice and already made some bad choices with this.
Therapist: Nina, I'm wondering, what's your hope for the future? When you think about where you are today, um, what do you hope for when you look ahead?
Client: Well, I-I kept the kid because I wanted-- It was almost like that push, that sign for me to, like, move forward and become like an adult because it's scary, right? Like I-I still feel like a teenager sometimes. And having that push to be a real person is really-- It's a lot of pressure and I-I want to raise this kid well. I don't wanna- I don't wanna let my kid down. I don't wanna, you know, I don't wanna regret choosing to have this kid because I think it's the right time, but I don't wanna- I don't wanna make mistakes that make me realize maybe I'm not ready for this 'cause sometimes it feels like I'm not ready for this.
Therapist: You put your heart there that the baby is really- it was almost kind of like a sign for you that was saying, ""This baby is giving you a kind of a new chance at life, or giving you a plan B,"" and you guys both get to decide what plan B is gonna look like.
Client: Yeah, I just guess it's easier said than done though. Like, it's, like, great, I can make all these changes and I can be a completely new person, but it's, like, at the end of the day, I'm still just who I am.
Therapist: While this baby's growing in you and you think of all the opportunities that could come out of this, there's a part of you that says, ""I'm still that same girl that was drinking and partying,"" and-and maybe not living the life you wanted to live.
Client: Yeah. And I'm just- you know, you can't just one day flick a switch and become a new person.
Therapist: While this baby feels like this is your second chance, you're wondering, ""Do I deserve that second chance?"" And then this other part of you that says, ""Why not? It's here and I wanna go for it.""
Client: Yeah, I guess that voice is just a little more stifled by the other one.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. You got a lot of people around you that are kind of pulling it down, and it's kind of taking you back to the old life. And the baby is a constant reminder that there’s this new life ahead.
Client: Yeah, it's gonna be very different when it actually comes.
Therapist: When you think about, you know, embracing this new life, and taking that different path, turning away from path A and moving into path B, how confident are you that you can take path B and be successful in raising this baby, and letting go with the drinking and the life that you were in-in path A?
Client: I think I'm gonna have to be successful. I don't really- I don't have any other choice. Like I have to- I have to take that path.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. Tell me more about that, what makes you say, ""I have to take that path""? What makes you feel like you need that?
Client: Because I need to for my kid. It's- it's gonna be all screwed up if I don't.
Therapist: This part of you that says, ""I don't have an option to-to-to make this life better,"" it's wondering, ""Do I have the confidence to be able to make that life a reality?"" What do you think you need to increase your confidence that you can do this?
Client: I don't know, like, maybe- maybe actually talking to my friends and saying like- or maybe them actually being able to see this kid and go, ""Of course, of course, your- your choice makes sense. You--"" Maybe it would, you know, give them a wake-up call too if They actually, like, see it.
Therapist: So you're thinking that, um, once your friends see you with the baby in your arms that they too will see that there's a different path for them too?
Client: Or at least they'll feel less pressure to be who they want me to be.
Therapist: Mm, kind of feel like you're pulled between two worlds there.
Client: A little bit.
Therapist: It's not easy to be in that world and also having that constant reminder that the baby is coming and this baby is saying, ""I want this better life,"" and you want to give the baby a better life too. Who can support you, do you think when-when you look around who's in your circle right now, who do you think can support you in moving towards path B?
Client: Definitely my parents, um, and I probably need to, uh, go and meet some other-other people who are maybe, you know, having kids too so that I can see, like how it's done 'cause like, I only have a younger brother who's like not-not even close to that. So I don't really have anyone in my life that I know that's had kids recently. So I-I would like to meet other, you know, young moms out there who, you know, are kind of struggling with the same stuff I am.
Therapist: And your parents are a support for you and support you from giving up the drinking, the alcohol use, that's something that they would support-
Client: I don't think they realize, uh, that I'm doing it or how much I'm doing it.
Therapist: Okay.

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: Uh, welcome. And, uh—
Client: Thank you.
Therapist: I'd say my name is Mark and I work here at Green Prescriptions. And-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: I know a little bit about you from the referral letter from the doctor.
Client: From my GP?
Therapist: From your GP, yeah.
Client: Uh.
Therapist: But before we get to anything, I'll probably want to just ask you a little bit about what's led you to come here today and get a bit of an idea about what's been going on for you.
Client: What's led me to come here?
Therapist: Mm.
Client: My GP.
Therapist: And what did he have to say?
Client: Well, um, you know, I had my sort of, uh, checkup.
Therapist: mm.
Client: And it revealed that apparently, I might have diabetes 2. Well, that's what he says.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Um, I-I think that I feel perfectly well. I-I'm, you know-- I understand people with diabetes are a little bit plumper than I am.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: But, um, that's really why I'm here. I'm on his command, almost.
Therapist: Right, so he kinda gave you a directive?
Client: Well, he did. He says he's going to put me on some sort of program if it gets worse.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: But as I say, I-I feel absolutely fine now.
Therapist: So it kind of came a bit of a surprise, you feeling okay.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: You go for this checkup with the doctor. And he says, ""You've got Type II diabetes.""
Client: Mm, I'm very surprised.
Therapist: Mm. Came out of the blue for you?
Client: Yes. I think it did.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: And you said you kind of don't fit that kinda Type II diabetes look. That you kinda have had this idea-
Client: I-
Therapist: -you've been-been overweight with it.
Client: That's what I understand.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: You know, and I'm not overweight.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I-I sort of look after myself to a limited extent in that way. Um, but I'm a busy person, I suppose I burn off the calories. And-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I don't know, really.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: My lifestyle—
Therapist: Hmm. So it doesn't quite fit in your head, Type II diabetes and-
Client: No.
Therapist: -your lifestyle?
Client: No, not at all.
Therapist: Comes as a big surprise. And what was your reaction when he told you that at the time?
Client: Well, I-I thought he must be joking. To be honest. I thought-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -you know, why you are-- Look around you.
Therapist: Mm, mm.
Client: um, I just felt that, um-- I mean, I don't think he was wasting my time because why would he do that?
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: Right?
Therapist: He's got a lot to do.
Client: Um-- Absolutely right.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: He's got a job to do. And obviously, the tests have come through. And I have got these signs of diabetes 2.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Right? Um, I just think that-- Well, I just don't feel like it, Mark.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Um—
Therapist: So how are you feel in your head-
Client: I feel absolutely fine.
Therapist: -and what the tests say kind of like don't join up.
Client: Yeah. Well, physically, I feel absolutely fine.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I'm-I'm-- I didn't see anything wrong with me at all.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: I mean, I get around, I sleep pretty well-
Therapist: Hmm-hmm.
Client: I sort of you know-
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: - I'm-I'm compos mentis. So I don't—
Therapist: Yeah. What's the problem? Mm.
Client: What is the problem?
Therapist: And how did this happen is probably kind of what you're also thinking. Well, how did this--?
Client: Well, uh, yes. I mean-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -I must admit, I haven't done too much research. I've been a bit busy.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Um, but he-he was saying something about, I don't know, family or whatever. I don't know.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And I don't know if it's hereditary.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I think he said something about it being hereditary.
Therapist: So he mentioned, it might be a family thing. And so you-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -maybe got from your parents or something of the sort.
Client: Yeah, it could be-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -because, um, my mother mentioned-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -that, uh, my father had diabetes-
Therapist: Right.
Client: -diabetes 2. And if I think about it, um, his brother-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -uh, I haven't seen him for years.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But he might well have it because he is-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -a pretty cuddly guy. You know-
Therapist: Right.
Client: He's pretty big.
Therapist: So he fits the picture-
Client: Well, yes, the stereotype,-
Therapist: -when you think about what he-he-- Yeah, he's stereotypical.
Client: Yeah, I guess.
Therapist: A little bit bigger, perhaps doesn't look after himself that well, and he fits that foot
Client: Well, yeah. I mean, as far as I know, I hadn't seen him for-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -I don't know how many years.
Therapist: Mm. So you got this knowledge as a witness there's some family history of diabetes in the past?
Client: Apparently so. Yes, apparently so.
Therapist: Doctor mentioned that as being a factor.
Client: Mm, I mean, it is hereditary, is it?
Therapist: That's certainly true. Yes. We know that people who've had parents or have been in the past, there is a hereditary factor or genetic factor in-involved.
Client: A genetic factor. And so, does that mean that if you've got, um, if you've got a history of this within your family-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -if it's a gene-- you are more likely than not to get it?
Therapist: Correct. Yeah.
Client: Also, it's—
Therapist: But it's not inevitable.
Client: Right. Okay.
Therapist: Because its genes or the-the-the-the hereditary factor is not the only factor that causes it or is involved in it happening to you. So there's other factors that come into play.
Client: I'm sure you're going to tell me what they are.
Therapist: Well, you've-you've mentioned some of the things you know, and one of those is hereditary factors. You mentioned that the doctor mentioned that. And what else do you know or have you heard? You say you haven't had a lot of time to do the research. What else? Other things you've.
Client: To be frank, Mark, I honestly don't know. I mean, I honestly don't know what causes it because I've never had any reason. It came upon me from the GP and it took me back.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, the hereditary thing I thought, well, maybe that's the explanation.
Therapist: That makes a bit of sense.
Client: And why go any further, it's there?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Can't help it.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: They live pretty long lives, they did, all right.
Therapist: They managed with it.
Client: Relatives relatively went into their 70s.
Therapist: Okay. I don't know if it'd be helpful for you if you'd like to know a little bit more about some of the factors involved in time Type II diabetes.
Client: Well.
Therapist: If that would help.
Client: If there's something that you think that-- Yes. Yes, of course.
Therapist: Well, I'll perhaps share with you what I know from working with other people and some of the things I've experienced in working with people.
Client: Okay.
Therapist: And see what you make of it. See if it fits a little bit more with where you're at. We know that there is a strong family factor or hereditary factor, so that's one aspect. So also it tends to happen a little bit later in life, rather than something you might get when you're a teenager, this type of diabetes. So-so it's a later onset. It takes a bit of time for it to develop maybe. And the main reason I think, um, the main aspect of it is that it, have you heard about insulin.
Client: I've heard of it yeah.
Therapist: So that's a hormone or a chemical, it allows you to utilize sugar in your body.
Client: Right.
Therapist: All right. And Type II diabetes typically people have a resistance or a resistance to insulin in their cells, in their fat cells or their muscle cells or liver cells. They can't use insulin. And so sugar builds up in your system.
Client: Are you saying that they-they like they can't digest insulin or is that?
Therapist: You need insulin in your cells, individual cells in muscle or in fat or wherever to, um, use up excess sugar or to utilize sugar.
Client: Oh, I see. So-so it's like a-it's like a balance.
Therapist: That's right.
Client: So insulin you-you.
Therapist: Kind of, as your.
Client: You have yourself draws bar.
Therapist: Yap.
Client: Or something, and then what balances that out in the body is the insulin taking off the excess.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Or-or digesting? Should I say the excessive sugars?
Therapist: That's a good way to think.
Client: Is that what happened?
Therapist: Exactly. And what's happening in Type II diabetes is your-your fat cells and liver cells and muscle cells are resistant to insulin. It's almost like they're saying we can't use that.
Client: Why?
Therapist: And if-- Well, there's a number of-- We're not entirely sure, there's a lot of research still going on as to how this happens and how that could be modified. But what we do know is that, um, one of the key things in managing it is to try and modify or modulate, control the amount of sugar that are in your system.
Client: Right. Okay.
Therapist: Yeah. So there's a couple of things that we know that people with Type II diabetes have to look after and have to think about if they want to control the amount of sugar that's in their system, which is the main issue that's causing some of the health problems that people have with Type II diabetes. Too much sugar, and if it's not able to be utilized in the blood cell, in the fat cells, or liver cells, and the muscle cells stays in your bloodstream. And that can cause problems with your circulation. So too high blood sugar and too low a blood sugar can be a problem. So sugar is the main concern in Type II- Type II diabetes.And you mentioned earlier on, a couple of things that the doctor-- You've mentioned some signs that he was kind of a little bit concerned about. Well, what things did you notice over the-over the last month or so?
Client: You mean, personally?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Well, I didn't know. I mean, the thing is you see that-- I mean, I did think about this a little bit and I thought, well, over time, if things happen slowly, you don't really notice.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: As you get older.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I don't-I don't leap over five bar gates like I used to, you know, um, as opposed to, uh, running with the backs now, I tend to spend more time, you know, with my old mates in the bar.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: At the rugby club and-and-and the such like, yeah. And, um, the fish I'm hooking, I'm not after the kings anymore, I go for the snapper now, it's a bit easier, you know.
Therapist: A slightly more sedate lifestyle.
Client: Yeah, absolutely. You just do.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: You just do. Um, so you're less demanding, I guess, on your-on your body, you realize, and you don't really want to do these things anyway. You know, you let the youngsters get home.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Been there, done that. So you don't really notice. So I'm coming back to this diagnosis I had from my GP and him saying, ""You've got diabetes 2,"" well, I should feel like that, shouldn't I?
Therapist: Yeah. It should feel like there's something really wrong with you.
Client: Yeah, I mean.
Therapist: What's-how have you been feeling over the last month? So, you say you're very busy you're doing a lot of work.
Client: Yeah, I mean I'm a busy person. All right? I uh, my work uh, I work in insurance, so I'm always hopping from one place to another place.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, I haven't noticed.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: I really haven't noticed how, um, okay I get a bit--I suppose I get a bit out of breath sometimes.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: If I rush too much that-that's true. Um, I suppose, um, I don't go upstairs two at a time anymore, I use one at a time.
Therapist: So a little bit sort of energy is not quite there sometimes? The vitality.
Client: Oh, certainly the energy I have is-is not what I-what I had. I mean I do need to, you know, I'm busy but I do need to sit down, um, uh, I do need to sit down and relax with a cup of coffee, you know, and, uh, things.
Therapist: Yeah, Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, more than I would normally.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But that would be, that would be about it.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, is it getting worse? I don't know. I-I-I suppose. What worse? Is it-is it increasing? Well, to say, I don't really notice it.
Therapist: You haven't noticed it. So it's a progressive, you know, you've just seen this, as-as you got older, things have slowed down. You know those activities you used to do, but that's kind of like what happens.
Client: Yeah, yeah. Um, at least, that's what I think. I mean I don't know if you're telling me that I should be more active or my GP is saying I should be more active.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, as I say, uh, you know I-I don't do any regular form of exercise, I have to say, not anymore.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: But maybe I-maybe I don't know.
Therapist: Hmm, a bit of a mystery there.
Client: I mean I've got uh, well I-I mean I've got a great lifestyle. I mean if it's very-it-it's very good. I mean I've got all my mates in down at the rugby club. And I've got uh, you know even in the summer when that's a bit damn. I used to coach rugby and I coached cricket when I finished playing. So-so I've got the-the guys in the cricket club, um, you know, for the-for the, uh, for the summer evenings. And, uh, and then, uh, the-then, of course, we've got the fishing, and that's all of us combined. We're a big gang, really.
Therapist: Really? So what I'm hearing is there's actually a lot of aspects in your life which are really good.
Client: Oh, I think my life yeah. My life is great.
Therapist: From your perspective, things are going well?
Client: My life is great, and then you turn around and say, ""Hey you've got-- you-you're ill, you're sick.
Therapist: Yeah. It doesn't fit.
Client: And um, no I'm not. But you see, he said to me that he's gonna put me on some sort of, uh, a daily monitoring of, is it sugar levels?
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: And I'm gonna have to take regular pills.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Well frankly, the only pills I take are sort of paracetamols.
Therapist: Yeah. When you get uh, a headache.
Client: For a bit of the head in the morning, you know.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um.
Therapist: So the idea of having to test-test your blood sugar and take medications is kinda like off--
Client: Come on, you know.
Therapist: And you know that's a bit too-
Client: Well, life is too short.
Therapist: Too much.
Client: You know it's the truth.
Therapist: Yeah. Okay.
Client: I mean you know—
Therapist: And you're here today and that's probably something in you you've thought well I'll follow this through, you know I'll-I'll come along and see what-see what they've got to say. And I'm just wondering for this session, for the time we have today, there's a number of things we could talk about. You mentioned a couple of things about your lifestyle and, um, medication is one thing you've been told by the doctor you might need to do that. And a number of things that we could talk about today. Which-which area would you think would be useful for you to focus on?
Client: Well there is-there is something that you sort of prompted me to think about, and, um, I split up-- My wife and I, we split up several years ago now. And, um, you know we've been married for many many years.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: And um, I think she used to look after me because she used to do the cooking and-and-and stuff like that.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And I have to say that I'm not the best cook in the world.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, and-and being on the run all the time and you know once I get back home, it's, you know, it's time to go down to the rugby club or whatever it might be, uh, we're out with the mates. And, uh, I-I do I suppose my food is not as healthy perhaps as it used to be when she was around. She's moved down to Hamilton to live with her mother, if you've met her mother. Anyway, but, um.
Therapist: So then, since you've been on your own since you've separated, divorced and you've noticed that the things you eat and how you eat has changed.
Client: Yeah, I mean mates and their wives are pretty cool about it sometimes.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Because, you know, they'll invite me for dinner and so on.
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: And, yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess, you know, that's when you, well, or whatever reason, you split up in life.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You start looking at the home life of somebody else, you're thinking, ""Hmm, I use d to have this.""
Therapist: Hmm. Yeah, yeah.
Client: And you think, "" This is nice food, "" isn't it? and you know.
Therapist: Yeah. And your-- part of your wife used to do a lot of that for you?
Client: Oh, she would do all the cooking. Yeah, yeah,
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I never bothered to boil an egg in the water, you know.
Therapist: And so she would kinda look after what you ate and healthy things that you had, spread in front of you and off you go.
Client: Totally. I mean, I was just in charge of the wine, you know.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. And now you have to think about what you might eat and sometimes you don't eat the best.
Client: Well I-- This is what I'm saying. Maybe I'm not thinking about it. Maybe that's the thing.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Maybe I'm just—
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You know, because it-- you know this-- the pizza shop's just on the road.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And then there's-- I mean, okay, I confess that lunchtime, occasionally, it's uh, I'm hungry and McDonald's is very convenient
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -or Kentucky Fried or whatever.
Therapist: Very appealing, isn't it?
Client: You know, it's very easy. and then, um, then you think to yourself, well-- I mean, I do think of myself that maybe I should have a few vegetables around here or whatever. But then you go out into the supermarkets, you know, and you can pick up, uh, your- one of your TV dinners.
Therapist: Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm.
Client: So you bring those in and you open them up and put them in the microwave and there's vegetables there.
Therapist: Yeah they look pretty good on the plate, don't they?
Client: Yeah, it looks- it looks fine, you know, et cetera. I mean, so that will happen occasionally if I've got a night in. But cooking-wise, no, I haven't cooked anything, um, other than boil the water for the kettle for a cup o coffee.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -for ages.
Therapist: They're food choices in what you eat and what's in your diet it's not what-something you actually you've actually been aware of or had to think about in the past.
Client: Yeah. I do miss her breakfast. I have to say, we used to have get a nice breakfast.
Therapist: So one thing that you noticed is diet and the eating patterns and-
Client: Well—
Therapist: -when you eat. That's one aspect. What other aspects do you think you've-- you would be--?
Client: Well, I used to be quite a heavy smoker, right? I mean, I'd smoke a pack in a half a day. And I knew that wasn't doing me any good.
Therapist: Right.
Client: I mean the thing is when you're a-- I mean, I've always smoked. So, but when you're young and you're a sportsman, you know—
Therapist: You kinda juggle those two things and kinda--
Client: Well, the two things they balance out, you know and everybody else is
Therapist: You still run and have a cigarette?
Client: You know, you pass a cigarette down the backline almost, don't you? You know, just before the game gets—
Therapist: Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, part of the culture.
Client: Yeah, part of the of the whole thing. And it's changed a bit now, because in my day when we were playing, of course, it was a very much more of a social game, which was spent-spent in the rugby club.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: That's why you played and it was a big buddy-buddy thing.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: That was rugby and cricket was the same really.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Um, but now—
Therapist: But over the years, you've actually reduced your smoking or you've stopped altogether or at times?
Client: Well I-I, yeah. I was getting a bit sort of-- I was getting a bit, you know, a bit wheezy and I thought, ""I'll cut this out.""
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: But I enjoy smoking. I really do enjoy it. So I cut it down to I suppose it's about 10 a day now.
Therapist: Okay, so you meant to reduce.
Client: Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: You were noticing that it's having an impact on your breathing and health wasn't so good.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: When you related that to your smoking, so you managed to reduce your smoking.
Client: Yeah, yeah. I sort of—
Therapist: So you've made our decision to do that?
Client: it-it-it's-- you know, she will, ""Why don't you give up? You've gone so far, why don't you just stop?"" But I don't want to.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: It's-it's-- I-I enjoy it, um—
Therapist: Yeah, and it's hard to get to stop something you enjoy, isn't it?
Client: Well, yeah. I mean, you know, the thing is that you get to, you know, you've got to-- when you get down to that, you, uh, you have to regulate sort of-
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You know, you have to be quite strong-willed about, I suppose, in a way.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: So you say, ""Okay, well, you don't have a cigarette unless you have a cup of coffee. [laughs]
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know.
Therapist: But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?
Client: Oh, yeah, yeah. I have two sugars. A couple of sugar in coffee. Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: So we cut that down as I say.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: But the problem goes that coffee, we're up to 8 or so, 10 cups of coffee a day now.
Therapist: You're drinking more coffee. So what I've heard you say so far is, if I can just start right back from the beginning and you used to come in and sais, ""I went to the doctor."" You went for-- it sounds like you went for just a checkup.
Client: No, you know, there's a friend of mine, one of the guys down the rugby club, he said- he said, ""I'm going for my annual, you know-
Therapist: MIT.
Client: -warranty of fitness, sort of thing, you know. And I thought, now that's an idea, not been to one of those.
Therapist: Got to check out, why not?
Client: So I'm 55, and you read in the papers, you know, it's that at 55 you will-- you know, heart disease is more prevalent
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: -and all these sorts of things that you get around this middle-age time. So I thought, ""Well, I'll go and have one."" And frankly, when I went along, I was very confident. I thought, you know, the doctor is going to saying, ""Hmm, I wish I was as healthy as you,"" sort of thing.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, but unfortunately, uh, he-he came up with this. And it's the only thing I think he really came up with. I think-
Therapist: So everything else looked pretty good?
Client: My cholesterol is quite good, not too bad.
Therapist: Cholesterol good, your weight is good.
Client: Yeah-yeah. Not too bad.
Therapist: Um, you are smoking, but you've managed to reduce that.
Client: Well, yeah, I've cut it down, yeah. I mean, that's been three years, mind.
Therapist: And anything else, you know, you go ticking down the list. The tire is good, oil good.
Client: Absolutely.
Therapist: So we're looking good.
Client: And then we come to this-
Therapist: And ah, hang on.
Client: -too much sugar in the tank, or something. I don't know.
Therapist: Yeah, there's something wrong with the, uh, with this bit.
Client: So, yeah.
Therapist: And it doesn't quite fit with how you see your own lifestyle.
Client: No.
Therapist: Because you've-- it sounds like what you've been doing, you've made some conscious effort to be aware of some of those things you might think are important.
Client: I mean, yeah. I mean, you know, the thing is, you see, the thing is, and I mean, and probably you've-- I think you've heard this before, but people, they turn around, oh, uh, you know, doom and gloom prophets, you shouldn't drink.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: You shouldn't smoke.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And then I think to myself, ""Well, maybe I shouldn't socialize."" And then after that, ""Well, maybe I shouldn't be alive.""
Therapist: So like a domino effect, and they'll all be just sitting-
Client: You know. I mean, what-what-what's going on here? This is- this is- this is so many people's lives.
Therapist: Mm-hm.
Client: And um, I suppose, you know, if it came down to it, then, and somebody said, ""Well, you can solve this problem by taking a pill once a day, um, you know, it will keep it down, and there will be no problems,"" Then I-I could go with that. But what I don't want to do, um, the doctor was saying, or insinuating, that I'd have to change my lifestyle.
Therapist: A bit broad kind of like you've gotta change everything.
Client: Yeah. It was um, and I-I said, well, no. I'm sorry. [coughs] I'm not going to change my lifestyle. I've got to where I am. I'm reasonably happy. Okay, I wish I wasn't separated. Okay, I wish my kids were-were still around, um, you know. One of them is off now in, um, in-- back in Europe playing rugby in France.
Therapist: Yeah. And your thought was, yeah, right, I hear that, but actually, I don't want to make all these big changes in my life.
Client: No, I don't want to, because I don't feel that I need to.
Therapist: Feel like you need to. Yeah.
Client: I mean, it's you know, why?
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Um, I can't argue with a medical professional, Mark, because I know nothing, you know.
Therapist: The test, is the test, and experience, yeah.
Client: So, I mean, what-what-what-what suggestions would you have? I mean, what-what sort of-
Therapist: I don't know. I think it's up to you where we start, and that's the question I've got in my mind. You've mentioned a couple of things that you've already made some effort, or been conscious of. You've mentioned the diet, you've mentioned your smoking, those are two quite important aspects that we often talk about here in how people work.
Client: Is smoking related to diabetes then?
Therapist: It can have an impact, yes. So smoking, um, affects your blood system, so it hardens the arteries, um, and over time, it can have a significant impact on the healing of wounds. So people with Type II diabetes, often, if they get a cut, or a bruise, or something, it takes a long time to heal. Smoking reduces the amount of oxygen in your system, so that can further, you know, limit the time it takes your body to heal.
Client: Oh.
Therapist: So we know that smoking and Type II diabetes together-
Client: Don't help.
Therapist: -isn't a good combination.
Client: Is it okay if you have one without the other? I'm sorry, it's a silly question. [laughs]
Therapist: Well, the question is, I suppose, that I have for you is, where would you think, for you, would be a good place to start? If you were gonna make any changes, even small changes at the beginning, rather than just thinking, oh, I got to change everything, which it sounds like you're not prepared to, you know, do a whole lifestyle change, and I don't think that's what we're talking about here. Where would you feel most comfortable to start if you were gonna make any changes at all?
Client: Where would I start? Well, I-- What if about if I cut down on sugar in the coffee? If we could have long blacks, no milk, and no sugar.
Therapist: Yeah. Hmm, that might be a start.
Client: I think I could- I think I could probably handle that.
Therapist: Hm. What we also find is that people make these little changes, small changes, and that starts to kind of well, it makes them-
Client: Something of a rollover effect.
Therapist: -rollover, the domino effect starts to happen, and they start looking at other aspects.
Client: Domino effect, yeah.
Therapist: So rather than thinking, ""oh, my God, I have to change all these things. I've gotta stop smoking, I've gotta exercise more, I've gotta, you know, start eating more fruit and vegetables,"" you might start with these small changes, and then-
Client: I mean, how much exercise should I do a week?
Therapist: Um, I-I'm reluctant to give a prescription for that because I think it's really up to you. And I think it depends on how things go, as to how much you need to do.
Client: Right.
Therapist: You mentioned earlier on, the doctors talking about you monitoring your blood sugar.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So on how-- It depends on how-how that goes. Let's say, if you started doing that and you do some more exercise, you start to have longer blacks, rather than short blacks with lots of sugar. And you get down the sugar and you find your blood sugar starts to come down, then we're heading in the right direction.
Client: Okay, so—
Therapist: So it's really, I suppose, up to how things go for you, and you get that feedback. And if that's going in the right direction, you carry on doing and do some more of that.
Client: So, a-are we saying then that-that, really all I need to do, for this moment, is I can forget about everything, but cut out the sugar, uh, in the coffee and the milk-- I don't know, but you might as well, you know, milk without sugar is silly. But, um, if we do that, is that where we start?
Therapist: I think where we start is where you feel comfortable starting.
Client: Well, I mean that's something that's not difficult to do.
Therapist: Apples for breakfast.
Client: You start off at breakfast and get yourself an apple, a bit-a bit of apple and-and so on. Um—
Therapist: So what I'm hearing you're kind of saying is, that there's-- You're now starting to think of some very useful little starting points.
Client: Maybe.
Therapist: Not huge changes, but some little things you could do.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And it's kind of dawning on you there may be some possibilities here for making some changes. Let me ask you this. Um, let's say you put some of these things in place and you start to make some of these small changes.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Um, where do you see that taking you in the next set of three, four, five years? You know, where do you want to be in three to four years' time? What would be your ideal picture?
Client: Well, you know, and this is difficult because I don't feel unhealthy now.
Therapist: No.
Client: So, I suppose it would be fun to-- Maybe I should join a club or two, that's what I'm thinking because I'll be with mates.
Therapist: Yeah? You like the social aspect?
Client: I love the social aspect of it, and, um, there's-there's-- I know there's a bar in this club as well. I-- Don't-don't misunderstand me, I don't drink-
Therapist: No, no, I get that. I get that.
Client: -till-- You know, I'm not an alcoholic or anything like that, I—
Therapist: So part of that whole keeping fit and exercise stuff is actually the social side of it, isn't it?
Client: So yeah, so to get that balance, and maybe that's what I'm actually missing in life, and maybe this is, um-- I mean yes I do get up in the morning sometimes, and I suppose I do feel a bit—
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: You know? Even after a decent night's sleep, you know?
Therapist: Haven't quite that-
Client: And you need-- I'm getting this cup of coffee and maybe I'm—
Therapist: And the coffee helps a little bit because it perks you up?
Client: And that gets me going. Yeah.
Therapist: And the sugar in it helps too.
Client: Yeah, the sugar gives me the boost, I suppose. I-it's fantastic.
Therapist: So what I'm hearing is that your life, your work, your routines are-- Sometimes you're driving or you've got to keep awake, get up in the morning sometimes and you haven't quite got that buzz or the energy. You need a shot, and then throughout the day you might need just more shots to keep that energy up.
Client: Hmm. If I give up sugar in my coffee, give up the milk, black coffees, right?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: if I find some social form of exercise, like squash.
Therapist: And an activity which has got a starting to finish and it's something you do for a slot.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And then there's maybe some social aspects to it as well.
Client: Yeah, and then—
Therapist: You can see some benefits and some enjoyment that.
Client: And then, you know, give this, say, six months, I don't know what period it would be, then go back to the GP and say, ""Test me again.""
Therapist: That sounds like a great plan.
Client: And so maybe that would, uh—
Therapist: Yeah, sounds like a good idea.
Client: Maybe it's an idea. I mean—
Therapist: I think anything you do, it has to be something you've decided. You know, just start where you want to start. You've mentioned some really good ideas about possibly getting a little bit more exercise into your life, doing something like squash or something of that nature. You've mentioned some really good ideas about reducing the amount of sugar you-you-you're-you're intaking during the day, and coffee is a good place to start. Having an apple for breakfast, I think you mentioned that, a bit of fruit.
Client: Yeah, like my wife used to. Yeah.
Therapist: Those are some really good ideas and good starting points. So thinking about it like that, what-- Where are you now? What's your-- What-what-- Where-where is your thinking now?
Client: Well, you see, I mean, I'm thinking, ""Actually it might not be a bad idea this,"" because [chuckles] it would mean I could socialize harder, couldn't I? No, no I'm just joking. Uh, but, um, yeah, I mean, why not? Why not? Why not? It might be fun, it's a new path.
Therapist: What's to lose? What's to gain?
Client: Well, it would appear that there is something to gain, and-- I mean, I-- What do I lose? I don't know until I do it. But I'm thinking that if I do it and I do what I'm enjoying doing, I won't miss what I'm not doing. Does that make sense?
Therapist: It does make sense, yeah.
Client: Um, yeah I don't mind. I-- It's not a—
Therapist: So when you look at it, there's probably more to gain from making these changes than there is to lose.
Client: I'll talk to Billy about, um-- Billy is, um, he's the gym bloke.
Therapist: Right.
Client: I'll have a word with him because I'm due down the club tonight.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Really.
Therapist: So you've got to work these things on your mind. You know, the-- And workout where's the place to start.
Client: Yeah, I think that you say where-where you're at now, where you're going, where—
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -and-and-and this is what I've got to do. I think I'm in a rut. I think that's where I've—
Therapist: You've been stuck?
Client: I'm-I'm just-- I'm-I'm satisfiedly sort of contented, uh, sitting in this- in this rut and, um, that my doctor has actually di-diagnosed me with diabetes 2-
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: -which he says can be managed, and you seem to be insinuating that it can be managed.
Therapist: Indeed, yeah.
Client: Uh, maybe this is a blessing, actually-
Therapist: So rather than--
Client: -because I think to myself, ""Well, if someday, I am diagnosed with diabetes, I'd just carry on and-""
Therapist: Carrying on.
Client: ""-sitting in the corner of the bar, and chat, and talk and probably get fat."" I don't know, and make it worse. And, yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.
Therapist: So it's been a bit of a-a bit of a shock, but now you kinda reflect on it.
Client: Yeah, that's cool.
Therapist: Maybe this is the-
Client: That's really cool.
Therapist: -bit of a shake that I needed, you know, just sort of remind me. I might feel okay. I might-- From my perspective, your perspective, you're thinking, ""Well, what's the problem? Everything's fine.""
Client: Mm.
Therapist: But now you seem to be thinking looking and thinking, ""Maybe things weren't, or aren't, as good as I thought they were.""
Client: Yeah, I mean, I think you're quite right. I think you just—
Therapist: Things could be better?
Client: I don't know, you become sedentary, don't you? No, it seems that-- No, actually, this is quite exciting. It quite [unintelligible 00:31:28]
Therapist: Yeah, I sense that. I sense that in you that you're--
Client: I think to myself, I think, ""Oh,"" I think go—
Therapist: Quite invigorated with the idea of--
Client: Yeah. I mean, this is- this is- this is cool, it's like an old challenge again.
Therapist: Making some of these changes. Yeah.
Client: This is good. And, um—
Therapist: You're up for the challenge?
Client: I think I am. I mean, I never thought about it, but when I think about it now it's, ""What am I doing here?"" Why am I like this? Why am I just happy contented to drift?
Therapist: So think about when you were-- This-this is an interesting question to see what you think. You were- you were a coach. You-- Maybe you'll be a coach again.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: What would you say if you were talking to yourself, if you like, you know, if you were the coach saying, ""Right--""
Client: Oh, so if I was obs- if I was sort of-
Therapist: Yeah, what-what would you be saying?
Client: -observing as it were?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Watching myself, what would I say? I-I-- Well, I would say, you know, are you happy?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: That-- Are you contented with that performance of you and your team?
Therapist: And, I suppose, our own personalized a little bit like that, there's lots of different aspects that need to be tweaked.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Modified and looked at, to get the best out of ourselves, to get the best out of the opportunities we have.
Client: I think you're- I think you're right. I think, um-- And again, you put them together and it's-it's-it's becoming-- It's-it's a sort of a-an individual team job, isn't it really?
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: That, okay, do a bit of this and do a bit of that.
Therapist: Some good things I'm- some things I'm good at and there are some other aspects we think, ""Well--""
Client: Yeah, but I don't have to give up anything really, do I?
Therapist: It's not about giving up your personality or-
Client: No.
Therapist: -changing who you are fundamentally.
Client: No it's not. It's not.
Therapist: It's just tweaking things. Just fine-tuning a few areas and being a bit more aw-aware of one aspect of your life a bit more, like the food choices or whatever. Well, Mike, I-I've really enjoyed listening to your perspective, and your story a little bit, and it's helped me a lot to get an idea about where you're coming from, and a little bit about who you are, and what's happened in your past. And-and we've also talked a bit about what's going to happen next. And you've come up with some great ideas. What I hear you saying is that, you know, before all this, before you met the GP, things are going fine.Well, as you would of-- As, you know, as you'd seen it, you were just doing your thing, and getting on working, and being busy, and being successful, and then suddenly this diagnosis, this doctor tells you that you've got a problem.
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: It comes along to me and talk today a bit about how you felt about that. Initially, it can be quite a bit of a-bit of a shock. It didn't quite fit with how you saw things.
Client: True, true.
Therapist: And as we've been talking, I'm hearing you're saying that maybe if you look back to where you were before you went to the doctor, things weren't quite that right, maybe. Things weren't as good as you thought they were.
Client: Now that I think about it- now that I think about it, maybe.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Maybe they were.
Therapist: And what I also hear you saying, it's possibly the-- It's now possibly more possible, in your mind, that you could make some of these changes, rather than bring broad-brush, you know, huge changes to your lifestyles. It's not about changing who you are, it's not changing huge facets of your life, but maybe small steps that need to be taken.
Client: Yeah, you see—
Therapist: What you're kind of thinking about what those might.
Client: Mm. When your life comes to a halt-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -your family splits up, or whatever, and you don't have anymore, I-I think you stop caring really. Uh, y-you know, you stop caring about yourself
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Because everything is just f-
Therapist: Nobody there too.
Client: Nobody there, [crosstalk] it's true and so,-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -you know,-
Therapist: Mhm.
Client: -you don't care.
Therapist: So now it's time-
Client: So that's maybe [crosstalk]
Therapist: -to think about looking after yourself a bit more.
Client: Maybe, a bit selfish but maybe why not?
Therapist: Why not?
Client: Why not? Yeah, that's a good idea.
Therapist: Yeah. So, we've run out of time but I also want to ask you a final question, where to from here, what's next?
Client: Oh right, well, wha-what we talked about. Now, you know, uh, okay, uh, coffee. Right? No sugar.
Therapist: You'll start with that?
Client: I'll start with that.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, I'm gonna, um, I'll be talking to Bill, uh-
Therapist: The gym.
Client: -about the gym but-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -I like the idea of, actually again doing squash-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -or something else-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -and I'm gonna go down to the rugby club and I'll- I know that will be accepted. I'll offer my services again because-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -it was reasonably successful.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And, uh—
Therapist: And you also mentioned you'll perhaps go and- back and see the doctor and just give him a bit of an update as to-
Client: No, [crosstalk] oh, well, okay, yeah I didn't- yeah, I'll go back and say-- Well, look, I'd-I'd rather not go back to the doctor and say, ""I'm gonna do this, this, this-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -this and this.
Therapist: Mhm.
Client: This is between you and me.
Therapist: Yep.
Client: All right?
Therapist: It's fine.
Client: But this is what I'm gonna do. All right? And like I said, I'm gonna make the inquiries, I will start there-
Therapist: Sure.
Client: -I will give up, uh, I'll give up the V drinks,-
Therapist: Mhm.
Client: -I think, um, look for some better wine. [laughter] Um, and-and I-I'd take an interest really.
Therapist: You are gonna make a start?
Client: I'll take an interest really and-and, uh, but it is quite exciting, Mark.
Therapist: It is. Well, just to help you, because there's probably a lot of other questions you might have, other questions that might come up after this session.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -before we go, I'd like to just-just give you a lot of- some information that might help-help you.
Client: Not too much.
Therapist: Not too much, just some stuff that might just give you a little bit of background information on-
Client: Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: -some of the things that have-
Client: Just give me a bit of background, really.
Therapist: -around type- around Type II diabetes and some,-
Client: Oh, yeah, and what it is-
Therapist: [unintelligible 00:36:53] some of that.
Client: -because I don't really know. Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: Um, and I'd like to us- for us to meet again, so to catch up with you and make an appointment before you leave. Just to see how things are going and-
Client: Okay.
Therapist: -see what sort of little changes you've managed to make. I'd be really [unintelligible 00:37:07]-

Feel free to return none as the therapist utterance might not have any reflection.

Here are a few examples.

Examples:

Example 1
Client: But-but the wheezing is something that I've definitely noticed a little bit.
Therapist: I guess I also wonder whether, regardless of-of if your asthma symptoms are connected to Oscar, that may be part of you feels like it's worth it because he's been-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: -such a big part of your life for so long.
Answer: complex

Example 2
Client: Um, I'm just- yeah I just like to have a few drinks. I mean, you know, obviously, I-I have, uh, this diagnosed condition, and-and I think, you know, if I were able to, you know, maybe take a few hits off of the joint and have a couple of beers, I think that's about the same as taking the medicine.
Therapist: Well, you know, what, I-- There are a lot of people that wouldn't disagree with you on that exactly. You know, so, um, uh, but I know that they-they were never quite sure how they were all interacting all together. Like the, um- the weed kind of tends to make people a little paranoid anyway.
Client: Yeah, I-I-I got to be careful with it. If I take more than a hit or two of it, it-it-it can be a bit of a problem.
Therapist: Yeah. Why, what happens if you take a little too much of it?
Answer: none

Example 3
Client: That's a good way to sum it up. And it's-- Well, you understand it, uh, it's just- it's not good.
Therapist: Mm. So, and then you said, you don't like how it makes you act, um, if you can tell me a little bit about that.
Answer: simple

Example 4
Client: Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know.
Therapist: But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?
Answer: complex

Example 5
Client: I wanna stay friends with them. I don't want- I don't want them to just-
Therapist: You don't wanna lose your support group, yeah. You just wanna them to support you in being healthy, while helping them, raising the babe, and so we're just taking path B. You don't wanna lose them, just maybe the lifestyle it sounds like.
Answer: none

Example 6
Client: Um, I mean, I guess- I guess I need some strategies for figuring out how to ease stress without, I guess, getting high.
Therapist: Okay. And that's a very good reason for being here. Um, can you talk to me about maybe some of your-- the goals that you have?
Answer: none

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: So, we were, um- we were just talking a little bit about sustained talk, which most people call denial.
Client: Well, I'm glad I don't have any of that.[laughter]
Therapist: You're a lucky man.
Client: Thank you.
Therapist: So, um, it also, um-- Anyway, it's-it's when people are just saying, ""Um, you know, this is why I don't wanna change. You know, I'm happy the way that I am. You know, it's, you know, um, God made it that marijuana stuff,"" you know, things like that. So-
Client: Yeah, okay.
Therapist: -so, you're gonna, um, play with me a little bit and, um-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -and you're gonna—
Client: Well, you were asking me why I don't like to take my medicine.
Therapist: Right. So, you're-you're a, um-um, a patient who's been diagnosed with some s- maybe schizophrenia, bipolar.
Client: I like to call it mild schizophrenia.
Therapist: Okay, mild schizophrenia is fine. Good. Okay, so-
Client: And-and-and, uh—
Therapist: -just a touch.
Client: Yeah, just a little schizophrenia. I'm-I'm-- But, I'm okay with it, and so am I.
Therapist: Okay. [laughs] And-and-and, uh, if you wanted to maybe even, you know, a little drinking and weed in there 'cause it's also very kind. [crosstalk]
Client: Oh, that makes me f-- Yeah, that makes me feel-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -relaxed.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I need that.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -I gotta be relaxed, you know-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -if-if you had, you know- if you had to ride around in the back of a garbage truck all day like I do-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -uh, it's, uh- it's stressful, you know. [clears throat] But, the doctor- you know, the other doctor put me on this medicine and-and I gotta take it every day. And, I-I don't like it. Uh, I'll just be honest with you, I don't like it.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: It doesn't-- I don't like the way it makes you feel, um, I don't like the way it makes me act, and it's taken my sex drive, and just thrown it at the back of the garbage truck.
Therapist: Well, that is a bummer. I mean—
Client: It is.
Therapist: So you said the-the first one you said, you don't like the way it makes you feel?
Client: Right.
Therapist: So, tell me a little bit about what you don't like about- what you've noticed about it?
Client: Well, i-it's kinda like I'm in kind of a dreamy world. I-it kind of, I don't know, i-it just seems like I'm kinda like living in the middle of a cotton ball or something like that, where just things are kinda soft and, I don't know, I-- It just, the-the spice of life doesn't seem to be there. It seems like everything's bland, and nothing really-- Food doesn't taste the same, and things don't smell right, and—
Therapist: Very dull.
Client: Very dull.
Therapist: Very dull.
Client: Very dull.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: That's a good way to sum it up. And it's-- Well, you understand it, uh, it's just- it's not good.
Therapist: Mm. So, and then you said, you don't like how it makes you act, um, if you can tell me a little bit about that.
Client: Well, I feel like it's taken part of my personality and just thrown it away. I don't really feel like I'm all there, right. You know, like, um, I like to be spontaneous and funny, and-and all that night, and I- and I don't-- You know, by the time I come up with a-a funny remark to the situation, everybody's left the room, and-[laughter]-stuff like that. And-and-- [chuckles]
Therapist: It's really, your timing is [unintelligible 00:03:13]
Client: Absolutely.
Therapist: So you feel slow.
Client: And so, as you can can tell, I didn't take my medication today, I'm-I'm-I'm really on my game today. So.
Therapist: So, it's, you know, thinking as quickly and responding as quickly and-and things like that-- [crosstalk]
Client: More like takes the edge off-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -for sure.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Well, you understand that.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: You-you can- you can understand why I don't take it.
Therapist: To tell you, it sounds terrible, actually. Yeah. So, that that-that really-- And then- and then, to top it all off, literally, I mean, no sex drive.
Client: Right-right.
Therapist: And-and your wife, what does she have to say about that?
Client: Well, she wants to know who I am and what did I do with her husband.
Therapist: Yeah. Where's Scott? Where did- where did Scott go? That feisty, spirited guy, where- where'd he go?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: With the libido out the door.
Client: Yeah. And, uh- and so, she-- Actually, she-- When I first went on the medicine, she thought I was maybe messing around with somebody else, 'cause, I-I just wasn't interested in it at all.
Therapist: Oh, okay.
Client: I canceled my subscription to the spice channel.
Therapist: I didn't even know they had a spice channel. [chuckles]
Client: I don't know if they still have it or not. [chuckles]
Therapist: So they-- So, um, before you started taking the medication, though, when she was, you know, um-- Even though now she's like, ""Where is my old Scott,"" and stuff, well, were there any times when she wanted you to go on the medication? And, if so, what-what prompted those?
Client: Well, if I stay off the medication too long, I-- Some people might say there's a problem with that, you know.
Therapist: You were right.
Client: Well, I guess running around the neighborhood with no clothes on isn't really good.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Um, I thought I had a, uh—
Therapist: Might get you into trouble [unintelligible 00:05:06]
Client: Yeah, well, I thought I had my gym shorts on, but they said that I didn't.
Therapist: Okay. What else?
Client: Well, I-I ended up in the hospital.
Therapist: What do you think about the hospital?
Client: Don't like that hospital.
Therapist: No.
Client: Uh. [clears throat] I'm not sure that the hospital is worse than the cotton ball, but I don't like it either.
Therapist: So, you'd really like to stay out of that hospital?

Client: Yeah, it'd be good.
Therapist: Yeah. Okay. So, what I'm really interested in is how offending fits in with that picture, that dream.
Client: I guess it doesn't.
Therapist: Yeah, how doesn't it fit, Billy?
Client: Uh, I guess I have to keep coming-coming back here and go into court and stuff.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah. It kinda messes things up.
Therapist: Yeah. It kinda messes up that dream, that picture?
Client: Yeah. It makes it harder.
Therapist: Mm. Makes it harder? Yeah. Well, it can make it harder to keep a job, aye?
Client: Mm.
Therapist: And harder to—
Client: Like it's hard to get a job 'cause you have to say that you've done prison time and stuff, so it's pretty hard.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And we've talked about that idea of you getting a job and something to do with cars 'cause that's where your passion is.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: Yeah? So, what have you been thinking, um, since we last met, about what you might do about getting that kind of job?
Client: Uh, I don't know if-if I would go into polytech, done courses there or something.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: Yeah. Like, if they've got jobs now.
Therapist: Okay, so you know some people?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: You've gone down that road of kind of going back to school in some ways and getting a tryout or-
Client: Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: -getting a qualification?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah? So, what-what would interest you about going down that same, sort of, path?
Client: Just learn more about cars and just, kind of, hands-on job.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. Yeah, so what in particular? Like, if you could have whatever you wanted, in terms of that sort of work, what would you do?
Client: [sighs] Mechanic, or panel [unintelligible 00:18:02], or just-- I wouldn't care, I just-- as long as it's cars.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. So, as long as it has to do with cars, you'd be sweet with that?
Client: Yes, pretty much.
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. So-so what sort of things do you think you need to do to go down that path to get that qualification?
Client: Just I have to get that training, I guess, and then probably get a job.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. So, what sort of training did you-- did these people, that you've been talking about, what did they do?
Client: Like, sort of, um, just at the polytech. I don't know what exactly it was, but—
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: It took them like-- And, it took them like a year or something, and then they went into apprenticeship.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah. So, how confident are you that you could do something similar to these-these friends that you've got?
Client: Yeah. I could do it pretty easy. It's just, like, I probably know all this stuff already.
Therapist: Okay. So, it would be pretty easy. So, if it's pretty easy, what do you need to do next, Billy?
Client: Like, well, I went out and picked some forms and stuff, but it's real confusing, like, having to apply, so I-I just couldn't-- I don't know. I couldn't do it.
Therapist: Okay. So, you actually went to the polytech—
Client: Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: -and picked up some forms?
Client: Yeah, yeah. Passed around and everything.
Therapist: Wow.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: That's fantastic, Billy.
Client: Yeah, but I just-- Like, they wouldn't help me out, so-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -I got some forms and-
Therapist: Tell me- tell me what happened when you say they-- like it didn't help you? What-what-what happened?
Client: I asked- I asked them what I had to do, and they said I had to fill out some forms, but-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -well, the forms, it's too confusing.
Therapist: Okay. So, they gave you a horde of forms for a particular course?
Client: Yeah, yeah. Well, I got one- I got one for panel [unintelligible 00:19:33], and one for, uh, uh, like, panel and paint-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -so, learning how to paint cars and stuff.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. So, you got the forms, took them- took them home?
Client: Yeah. I was gonna fill them out there, but then I didn't get them, so I took them home, but I was gonna get Donna to help me, but I just didn't get around to it.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. You said the forms were confusing?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah? What-what's the confusing bit?
Client: I didn't understand, like, what you're supposed to write down. Like, yeah. I'm not good at this, maybe too confusing.
Therapist: Yeah. So, when you've had to write things or fill out forms before, how-how's that been for you?
Client: I don't really deal with it. I s-- I don't really like writing.
Therapist: You don't like writing?
Client: No.
Therapist: Yeah. So, wondering what that's about, about not actually liking writing.
Client: No, I'm just real messy, so people can't read it.
Therapist: People can't read-- People can't read your handwriting?
Client: [chuckles] Yeah, no. It's what they say, yeah.
Therapist: Oh, you must be a doctor.
Client: Yeah, I am. [chuckles]
Therapist: Yeah? [chuckles] Yeah?
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. So, you need some help to fill out the forms?
Client: Yeah. Like, a computer or something. If you could write on a computer, I could do that.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: But, we don't have a computer.
Therapist: Okay. All right, so what-what do you need to do, Billy, to actually get to that point where you can fill out a form and post it off?
Client: Just ask to get someone else to do it I guess. I guess I could ask Donna, but it's been embarrassing.
Therapist: Okay, so you feel like it would be embarrassing to ask Donna to give you some help-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -because you feel that she might find out something about you that you're not quite sure you want her to find out?
Client: Well, I don't know if it's that serious, it's just-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -I'm sure most people can fill them out. I don't know, I just don't get it.
Therapist: Hmm. So, who else could you ask to help you?
Client: No one. I guess you. You could do it. Would you do it?
Therapist: Well, have you got the forms with you?
Client: No.
Therapist: Okay. I'm wondering about-- because it sounds like this whole idea about filling out the forms, is getting in the way of this bigger dream that you've got which is around getting a qualification around something to do with cars-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -and getting on this road where you're staying out of trouble because you've got this, um, interest-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -which you can do. So, it seems a real shame that the forms are gonna get in the way, so we need to find a way around the forms.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: Yeah? So, what do you think, between now and next week, you can do around the forms?
Client: I guess, I'd go pick them up and I don't know, I guess I could ask Donna, but she'd probably help me, I don't really want to.
Therapist: She'd probably help you, but you don't really want to. It sounds like you're a bit embarrassed.
Client: Well, I don't know. Plus, well, I don't know if I could bother getting up at nine o'clock every morning and having to go to Polytec. I've got used to sleeping in.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: At night.
Therapist: So, the whole thing about going back to poly-- going back to school-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -going back to polytech is-- would-would require a really big change in the way which you're currently living, and you're not quite sure if you can do that.
Client: Yeah. Uh, it would be cool if it's anything like school. Like, I didn't really enjoy school. [unintelligible 00:22:56] so writing and stuff, and I wouldn't wanna do that. If it's all hands-on though, it would be all good.
Therapist: Yeah. So, there's something here about your level of-- about how confident you are around writing or how unconfident you are, that sounds like it's getting in the way.
Client: Yeah. No, it does get in the way. I just don't wanna do it.
Therapist: Mm. Okay.
Client: It's a waste of time.
Therapist: All right. So, it sounds like we might need to have some more conversation around that.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So, what's really getting in the way?
Client: For what?
Therapist: Well, this writing business. What's really getting in the way?
Client: Of what? Well, I don't get it.
Therapist: Well, I'm wondering, like-- it sounds like it's a thing that you're putting up as saying you can't do-
Client: Yeah. I can't.
Therapist: -so I'm wondering where you are around your writing and you're reading?
Client: Oh, it's pretty [unintelligible 00:23:47], but, like, still-- I don't know, I'm not retarded, or anything. I can write and read.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah. Well, I have to say, I think it's really obvious that you're not retarded.
Client: Like--
Therapist: [chuckles]
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Yeah, we are having a really good conversation here.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So, reading and writing is not a strong point for you.
Client: No, not really. Yeah, I don't really enjoy it.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So, how much reading and writing is involved in the course that you're gonna go on?
Client: I don't know. Hopefully, not many-- not much, but that's what I wanna find out, I guess.
Therapist: So, what'd it be like if you were more confident in your reading and writing? What'd that be like?
Client: It'd make everything easier.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Like-- I don't really like reading books or anything, so I don't really care about that but just, say, real-life stuff like going to the bank, and stuff like that-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -yeah, that have filling out forms.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And, I guess that there will be manuals and stuff like that on-

Answer: complex

Example 2
Client: Um, I'm just- yeah I just like to have a few drinks. I mean, you know, obviously, I-I have, uh, this diagnosed condition, and-and I think, you know, if I were able to, you know, maybe take a few hits off of the joint and have a couple of beers, I think that's about the same as taking the medicine.
Therapist: Well, you know, what, I-- There are a lot of people that wouldn't disagree with you on that exactly. You know, so, um, uh, but I know that they-they were never quite sure how they were all interacting all together. Like the, um- the weed kind of tends to make people a little paranoid anyway.
Client: Yeah, I-I-I got to be careful with it. If I take more than a hit or two of it, it-it-it can be a bit of a problem.

Answer: none

Example 3
Client: That's a good way to sum it up. And it's-- Well, you understand it, uh, it's just- it's not good.

Example 6
Client: Um, I mean, I guess- I guess I need some strategies for figuring out how to ease stress without, I guess, getting high.

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: Uh, welcome. And, uh—
Client: Thank you.
Therapist: I'd say my name is Mark and I work here at Green Prescriptions. And-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: I know a little bit about you from the referral letter from the doctor.
Client: From my GP?
Therapist: From your GP, yeah.
Client: Uh.
Therapist: But before we get to anything, I'll probably want to just ask you a little bit about what's led you to come here today and get a bit of an idea about what's been going on for you.
Client: What's led me to come here?
Therapist: Mm.
Client: My GP.
Therapist: And what did he have to say?
Client: Well, um, you know, I had my sort of, uh, checkup.
Therapist: mm.
Client: And it revealed that apparently, I might have diabetes 2. Well, that's what he says.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Um, I-I think that I feel perfectly well. I-I'm, you know-- I understand people with diabetes are a little bit plumper than I am.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: But, um, that's really why I'm here. I'm on his command, almost.
Therapist: Right, so he kinda gave you a directive?
Client: Well, he did. He says he's going to put me on some sort of program if it gets worse.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: But as I say, I-I feel absolutely fine now.
Therapist: So it kind of came a bit of a surprise, you feeling okay.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: You go for this checkup with the doctor. And he says, ""You've got Type II diabetes.""
Client: Mm, I'm very surprised.
Therapist: Mm. Came out of the blue for you?
Client: Yes. I think it did.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: And you said you kind of don't fit that kinda Type II diabetes look. That you kinda have had this idea-
Client: I-
Therapist: -you've been-been overweight with it.
Client: That's what I understand.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: You know, and I'm not overweight.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I-I sort of look after myself to a limited extent in that way. Um, but I'm a busy person, I suppose I burn off the calories. And-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I don't know, really.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: My lifestyle—
Therapist: Hmm. So it doesn't quite fit in your head, Type II diabetes and-
Client: No.
Therapist: -your lifestyle?
Client: No, not at all.
Therapist: Comes as a big surprise. And what was your reaction when he told you that at the time?
Client: Well, I-I thought he must be joking. To be honest. I thought-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -you know, why you are-- Look around you.
Therapist: Mm, mm.
Client: um, I just felt that, um-- I mean, I don't think he was wasting my time because why would he do that?
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: Right?
Therapist: He's got a lot to do.
Client: Um-- Absolutely right.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: He's got a job to do. And obviously, the tests have come through. And I have got these signs of diabetes 2.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Right? Um, I just think that-- Well, I just don't feel like it, Mark.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Um—
Therapist: So how are you feel in your head-
Client: I feel absolutely fine.
Therapist: -and what the tests say kind of like don't join up.

Therapist: Hmm.
Client: - I'm-I'm compos mentis. So I don't—
Therapist: Yeah. What's the problem? Mm.
Client: What is the problem?
Therapist: And how did this happen is probably kind of what you're also thinking. Well, how did this--?
Client: Well, uh, yes. I mean-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -I must admit, I haven't done too much research. I've been a bit busy.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Um, but he-he was saying something about, I don't know, family or whatever. I don't know.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And I don't know if it's hereditary.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I think he said something about it being hereditary.
Therapist: So he mentioned, it might be a family thing. And so you-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -maybe got from your parents or something of the sort.
Client: Yeah, it could be-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -because, um, my mother mentioned-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -that, uh, my father had diabetes-
Therapist: Right.
Client: -diabetes 2. And if I think about it, um, his brother-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -uh, I haven't seen him for years.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But he might well have it because he is-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -a pretty cuddly guy. You know-
Therapist: Right.
Client: He's pretty big.
Therapist: So he fits the picture-
Client: Well, yes, the stereotype,-
Therapist: -when you think about what he-he-- Yeah, he's stereotypical.
Client: Yeah, I guess.
Therapist: A little bit bigger, perhaps doesn't look after himself that well, and he fits that foot
Client: Well, yeah. I mean, as far as I know, I hadn't seen him for-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -I don't know how many years.
Therapist: Mm. So you got this knowledge as a witness there's some family history of diabetes in the past?
Client: Apparently so. Yes, apparently so.
Therapist: Doctor mentioned that as being a factor.
Client: Mm, I mean, it is hereditary, is it?
Therapist: That's certainly true. Yes. We know that people who've had parents or have been in the past, there is a hereditary factor or genetic factor in-involved.

Client: Thank you, my doctor [unintelligible 00:00:05]
Therapist: What brings you in?
Client: Well am having, um-- I've been an ongoing problem with smoking and trying to quit.
Therapist: So, you'd like to give up those cigarettes?
Client: Oh I've been wanting to, for a long long time in years.
Therapist: Yeah, so then it's, um, right now, uh, tell me a little bit about, um, right now at this point in your life why it's so important to quit.
Client: Well I have a 15-year-old daughter and she's highly against it. And, um, health issues, you know, I'm getting-- not getting any younger and I have asthma and I have chronic bronchi-- bronchitis and, um, I'm having a hard time breathing when I exercise and not to mention it's socially unacceptable really.
Therapist: Like being a leper in a leper colony right now to be a smoker.
Client: Actually it's like being a leper in a non-leper colony.
Therapist: 'Cause you can't find a leper colony anymore. So, um, so it-it's really important for you to be a good mum-
Client: Right.
Therapist: -and model for your- for your daughter who's at this age where 15 would be a really common age at which she might decide to smoke.
Client: Right and, um, she's been expressing, you know, she walks in and she's like shhh and it's embarrassing for her friends and, um, and in-in turn, it's embarrassing for me.
Therapist: Okay. So, you-you wanna look good, you know, and she's proud of you I'm sure anyway and then this just would be an added benefit. Yeah.
Client: Right right, yeah.
Therapist: So, and then you mentioned quite a few things about medical problems. So, um, you mentioned, um, asthma, um, acute bronchitis did you say—
Client: Oh and emphysema the beginning stages of emphysema.
Therapist: Oh my goodness. Okay. And so, and that-- yeah, that's very-- that's really scary beginnings of emphysema, I'm sorry to hear that.
Client: Thank you.
Therapist: Well, I mean that's-that's, you know, tell me about when you were diagnosed with that.
Client: I really couldn't tell you, um, I remember when my daughter was like five, um, I was-- it was humid out and I have a problem with humidity-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -you know, for breathing, um, and, um, I was trying to stick my head out the window to gasp for air-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -and my daughter became so frightened that she went next door to our neighbor and called 911 and it really—
Therapist: Smart girl.
Client: Yeah-Yeah she's very intelligent, yeah. Um, and they came they took me, you know, on this chair type of thing in my robe and my daughter was in sure panic, um, thinking she's was gonna lose me and she's 15 so its been 10 years since then and I still I've tried this Chantix-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -unsuccessfully, uh,--
Therapist: Tell me a little bit about what happened with the-the Chantix.
Client: Well, um, I don't know if it's my lack of willpower but, um, also had ve-very bad side effects from it so.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Wh-What sort of if-if you are willing to talk about what kind of side effect—
Client: Um, I had nightmares-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -nausea-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -um, stomach problems, and agitation. Yeah.
Therapist: Oh really. You know, and I've heard that too, Carrie, that people especially you know those are, um, some people seem to have a lot of success but when people do have the adverse side effects they are really pronounced like the ones you just described.
Client: Right and it didn't stop me from smoking as well, so that's, uh, [laughs]—
Therapist: Want the good [crosstalk] no good right? And how long ago was that that you—
Client: Um, that was about two to three years ago.
Therapist: Okay, all right.
Client: I tried it a couple of times.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: I would get a, um, a new prescription refilled thinking, ""Oh I could try it this time.""
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: And I had friends that it worked for-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: Um, and there is a support group that they have that you can go online or call-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -but of course I didn't do either but-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -um—
Therapist: It just didn't fit for you to do the online.
Client: No. Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. So, um, but you gave it a good try and it was just not a good fit for you like you-you really listened to what your body told you like nightmares, nausea, I mean those are really bad things.
Client: And agitation really-
Therapist: Oh yeah.
Client: -because, um, you know, um, being at my age I'm going through the menopause stage which is part, you know, you'll have that anyways and then having 15-year-old that causes a little bit more stress so you don't need any extra stress, I don't think, as far as I'm concerned.
Therapist: So, it's already piled I'm thinking up for you, you don't need anything else so you're looking for some relief and not something to make you feel worse.
Client: Right, exactly.
Therapist: Um, have there been some times in the past where you were able to quit smoking completely?
Client: Only when I was in the hospital. [chuckles]
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And even then I-I snuck out and had a cigarette, you know.
Therapist: Okay. So, what's the longest you've ever gone without a cigarette including being in the hospital?
Client: Oh God, I would have to say, uh, three days.
Therapist: Oh, three days. You know, that's a long time and I felt, you know, that's a pretty long time to go without smoking and I would imagine, I think that's pretty good.
Client: But it was not really by choice, it was by, um, the situation I was in, I wasn't able to smoke so, yeah.
Therapist: You were forced to-
Client: Right.
Therapist: -not smoke?
Client: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Therapist: What did you notice during those three days when you weren't smoking?
Client: Um, constant thoughts about smoking.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: Um, uh, just as, um, a chocoholic craves chocolate-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -I was craving my cigarette.
Therapist: You were [unintelligible 00:06:04]
Client: Yeah, exactly. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Um, and the first thing when I was able to smoke, I didn't care if I smoke my brand or anybody else's brand, I just wanted that cigarette.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: The nicotine is the addiction.
Therapist: Right.
Client: And-and also the-the psyche thing, you know, with-- I mean, I wake up in the morning, I want a coffee with- I want coffee with a cigarette.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: Um, if I'm stressed, coffee with a cigarette.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: I mean, just cigarette. Um, so it's always, like, it's-it's a duel kind of problem I think-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -you know-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -I'm finding it to be.
Therapist: It does, uh, it does a lot of positive things for you.
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: And it sounds like it's paired, like a coffee and a cigarette. I mean, you know, probably hard to think about, ""How will I have a cup of coffee without a cigarette?""
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: You know, and, um, that's actually, yeah, that's a-- I think it does become very paired with lots of different things. And, um, you might already know this, and so let me know if you do, um, because of the way cigarettes you're describing it and accurately is-- it is really what we call an almost perfect drug in a lot of ways. And-
Client: Oh, really?
Therapist: -it will do whatever you need it to do at any given time. The downside is-is it-it kinda get, it gets in the end with the health.
Client: Oh, yeah.
Therapist: It'll-it'll take a good usually 10 years off your life minimum.
Client: As they say, my aunt was like, ""Put another nail in your coffin,"" you know.
Therapist: Okay. What do you think when she says that to you?
Client: More on kind of cocky and I say, ""Well, you know, Aunt Kathy, you were my role model, and back in the day, um, I used to envy and watch and think you were so sexy, and all the movies, the old movies.""
Therapist: Glamourous.
Client: Yes, yeah. And that's what I associated with at the time and now it's almost, I'm ostracized for it.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: So, it's kind of like a double-edged sword.
Therapist: So, and I would- I would-- it really is because it wasn't like that 20 years ago.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: It wasn't like that for sure 30 years ago.
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: So, it's become harder to be a smoker. You light up a cigarette-cigarette and people make assumptions about you.

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: Thank you for coming in to see me today, Nina. I'm looking forward to getting to know you a little bit and hearing a little bit about you and what brought you in here today.
Client: Um, my doctor referred me. He said I had to come because I've- I've been a little irresponsible with this pregnancy. Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. He's thinking you were a little irresponsible.
Client: Yeah. Um, he said that I was drinking too much with it. Um, I-I haven't been a lot, but he said it was still maybe, um, would screw things up.
Therapist: And you're feeling kind of concerned about that.
Client: Yeah. Yeah. Like I don't- I don't want to screw anything up with this baby, but, um, yeah, I'm just- I'm scared I already did.
Therapist: Okay. So, you're concerned about the consequences, and you really care about your baby, and you want to give your baby the best start you can.
Client: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Therapist: And you're wondering a little bit about this time that we're going to spend together.
Client: Yeah. He didn't really tell me what to expect. He just said, ""Go- go see her as well.""
Therapist: So here you are today and, um, you're sharing that you have been drinking alcohol throughout your pregnancy.
Client: Yeah. Um, I didn't find out I was pregnant until probably two-ish months in-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -and I had already been drinking then. Um, I've been really trying not to, but, you know, weekends come around, and, um, all my friends are kind of partying and stuff, and it's been hard to, like, break that habit.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. So, there's this external pressure coming from the people you care about to sort of stay in the scene.
Client: A little bit. I think if I- if I talk to them, it would be fine, but it's-it's weird, right? Like I'm the only one of my friends that's, like, taking this step and having a kid, and they don't really know how to handle that.
Therapist: Kind of feels like You're between two worlds. In one world, you're preparing to be a mother and bring a baby into this world, and this other world is the world that you've been in for a while where you're kind of having a good time and-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -drinking and your friends are-
Client: Yeah, like, I'm- I'm still, like, I'm only in my 20s, and-and for everyone else, it's like, ""Okay, it's party time,"" and now I kind of have to, like, break out of that.
Therapist: Okay. So, this party-time world's- are you feeling like this is something you want to move out of and move into that mom world? Or does it feel like I want to hang out there still too?
Client: There's, yeah, there's part of me that still wants to live that out because I'm not going to have another chance, like once this kid comes, it's-it's going to be over. I know I'm gonna- I know I'm going to have to change.
Therapist: So, for you, you're feeling like once the baby comes and actually in your arms, then things are going to change, but right now, while you're pregnant, you're thinking, ""I can kind of hang out in both worlds a little bit,"" but part of you may be thinking maybe that's not the case. It's time to go to the mom world maybe.

Client: Thank you, my doctor [unintelligible 00:00:05]
Therapist: What brings you in?
Client: Well am having, um-- I've been an ongoing problem with smoking and trying to quit.
Therapist: So, you'd like to give up those cigarettes?
Client: Oh I've been wanting to, for a long long time in years.
Therapist: Yeah, so then it's, um, right now, uh, tell me a little bit about, um, right now at this point in your life why it's so important to quit.
Client: Well I have a 15-year-old daughter and she's highly against it. And, um, health issues, you know, I'm getting-- not getting any younger and I have asthma and I have chronic bronchi-- bronchitis and, um, I'm having a hard time breathing when I exercise and not to mention it's socially unacceptable really.
Therapist: Like being a leper in a leper colony right now to be a smoker.
Client: Actually it's like being a leper in a non-leper colony.
Therapist: 'Cause you can't find a leper colony anymore. So, um, so it-it's really important for you to be a good mum-
Client: Right.
Therapist: -and model for your- for your daughter who's at this age where 15 would be a really common age at which she might decide to smoke.
Client: Right and, um, she's been expressing, you know, she walks in and she's like shhh and it's embarrassing for her friends and, um, and in-in turn, it's embarrassing for me.
Therapist: Okay. So, you-you wanna look good, you know, and she's proud of you I'm sure anyway and then this just would be an added benefit. Yeah.
Client: Right right, yeah.
Therapist: So, and then you mentioned quite a few things about medical problems. So, um, you mentioned, um, asthma, um, acute bronchitis did you say—
Client: Oh and emphysema the beginning stages of emphysema.
Therapist: Oh my goodness. Okay. And so, and that-- yeah, that's very-- that's really scary beginnings of emphysema, I'm sorry to hear that.
Client: Thank you.
Therapist: Well, I mean that's-that's, you know, tell me about when you were diagnosed with that.
Client: I really couldn't tell you, um, I remember when my daughter was like five, um, I was-- it was humid out and I have a problem with humidity-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -you know, for breathing, um, and, um, I was trying to stick my head out the window to gasp for air-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -and my daughter became so frightened that she went next door to our neighbor and called 911 and it really—
Therapist: Smart girl.
Client: Yeah-Yeah she's very intelligent, yeah. Um, and they came they took me, you know, on this chair type of thing in my robe and my daughter was in sure panic, um, thinking she's was gonna lose me and she's 15 so its been 10 years since then and I still I've tried this Chantix-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -unsuccessfully, uh,--
Therapist: Tell me a little bit about what happened with the-the Chantix.
Client: Well, um, I don't know if it's my lack of willpower but, um, also had ve-very bad side effects from it so.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Wh-What sort of if-if you are willing to talk about what kind of side effect—
Client: Um, I had nightmares-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -nausea-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -um, stomach problems, and agitation. Yeah.
Therapist: Oh really. You know, and I've heard that too, Carrie, that people especially you know those are, um, some people seem to have a lot of success but when people do have the adverse side effects they are really pronounced like the ones you just described.
Client: Right and it didn't stop me from smoking as well, so that's, uh, [laughs]—
Therapist: Want the good [crosstalk] no good right? And how long ago was that that you—
Client: Um, that was about two to three years ago.
Therapist: Okay, all right.
Client: I tried it a couple of times.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: I would get a, um, a new prescription refilled thinking, ""Oh I could try it this time.""
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: And I had friends that it worked for-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: Um, and there is a support group that they have that you can go online or call-
Therapist: Okay.
Client: -but of course I didn't do either but-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -um—
Therapist: It just didn't fit for you to do the online.
Client: No. Yeah.
Therapist: Okay. So, um, but you gave it a good try and it was just not a good fit for you like you-you really listened to what your body told you like nightmares, nausea, I mean those are really bad things.
Client: And agitation really-
Therapist: Oh yeah.
Client: -because, um, you know, um, being at my age I'm going through the menopause stage which is part, you know, you'll have that anyways and then having 15-year-old that causes a little bit more stress so you don't need any extra stress, I don't think, as far as I'm concerned.
Therapist: So, it's already piled I'm thinking up for you, you don't need anything else so you're looking for some relief and not something to make you feel worse.
Client: Right, exactly.
Therapist: Um, have there been some times in the past where you were able to quit smoking completely?
Client: Only when I was in the hospital. [chuckles]
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And even then I-I snuck out and had a cigarette, you know.
Therapist: Okay. So, what's the longest you've ever gone without a cigarette including being in the hospital?
Client: Oh God, I would have to say, uh, three days.
Therapist: Oh, three days. You know, that's a long time and I felt, you know, that's a pretty long time to go without smoking and I would imagine, I think that's pretty good.
Client: But it was not really by choice, it was by, um, the situation I was in, I wasn't able to smoke so, yeah.
Therapist: You were forced to-
Client: Right.
Therapist: -not smoke?
Client: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Therapist: What did you notice during those three days when you weren't smoking?
Client: Um, constant thoughts about smoking.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: Um, uh, just as, um, a chocoholic craves chocolate-
Therapist: Mm.

Therapist: Like being a leper in a leper colony right now to be a smoker.
Client: Actually it's like being a leper in a non-leper colony.
Therapist: 'Cause you can't find a leper colony anymore. So, um, so it-it's really important for you to be a good mum-
Client: Right.
Therapist: -and model for your- for your daughter who's at this age where 15 would be a really common age at which she might decide to smoke.
Client: Right and, um, she's been expressing, you know, she walks in and she's like shhh and it's embarrassing for her friends and, um, and in-in turn, it's embarrassing for me.
Therapist: Okay. So, you-you wanna look good, you know, and she's proud of you I'm sure anyway and then this just would be an added benefit. Yeah.

Client: Um, I'm just- yeah I just like to have a few drinks.

Therapist: Well, you know, what, I-- There are a lot of people that wouldn't disagree with you on that exactly. You know, so, um, uh, but I know that they-they were never quite sure how they were all interacting all together. Like the, um- the weed kind of tends to make people a little paranoid anyway.

Therapist: Mm.
Client: Well, food really doesn't taste good, but they say it tastes much better-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -if you quit smoking.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: Now the downside to that is I'm gonna gain weight.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: That means a new wardrobe, which I'd like to have, but I can't afford it.
Therapist: Okay. So right now you're seeing that it's a part of your life. It's been a part of your life off and on for 18 years.
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: It's become a more important part of your life because you found yourself smoking at times that you thought I'll never smoke then.
Client: Right.
Therapist: Yeah. And your worry is that if you stop, you will end up gaining weight. So I'm hearing this kind of list of things that don't feel so positive about stopping.
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: I'm wondering what else might be on that list.
Client: Um, withdrawal.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: They say it's awful. Um, being cranky.
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: And if I do go through this, I just hope my friends understand and will support me in what I'm trying to do.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. So added to the other list is the having to go through the withdrawal-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: -the unpleasantness of that. Okay. What else might be on the, not so good side about smoking- about stopping?

Now, look at this utterance and output one word which is the correct answer.","Therapist: Hi Mr. Johnson?
Client: Hey.
Therapist: Hi, I'm Tonny Brownie, I'm a pharmacist here, uh, and I- and I was wanting to spend just a little time with you talking to you about your cholesterol. I found out you're newly diagnosed and your medicine for your cholesterol.
Client: Yeah, my doctor talked to me about my cholesterol, that-that's-that's his job.
Therapist: Okay, certainly glad to hear that your doctor did spend some time with you, um, I-I see myself as somebody who works with your doctor, uh, to help you get the most benefit from your medicine, uh, because you are gonna spend money on it we wanna make sure that you get the most benefit from it. Uh, also sometimes it may be difficult to reach your doctor we're also here, uh, and so we try to work together, wo-would that be okay?
Client: Yeah, that'd be okay, yeah, you know, I'm not so certain I'm even gonna take the medicine cause, you know, he mentioned muscle weakness, uh, you know, I-I know I got high cholesterol, uh, and that I'm running the risk of stroke and heart attack down line but yeah, he mentioned muscle weakness and I've been thinking about that and, uh, you know I'm a truck driver and I got a haul the heavy boxes out of the truck on a dolly, and I can't afford that right now. Just that-that muscle weakness, uh, that-that bothers me.
Therapist: So-so on the one hand, the doctor talked to you about high cholesterol, down the line possibly causing a stroke or heart attack-
Client: Oh, yeah.
Therapist: -and that would be pretty serious. On the other hand, uh, when you found out that this drug might cause muscle weakness, that really alarmed you.
Client: Yeah, that's the problem, that's what I face now with my job.
Therapist: Especially with your job and-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -preventing you from doing your livelihood.
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: Okay, um, would you mind if I talk to you, if-if I- if I gave you a little bit of information about the muscle weakness, and you tell me what you think?
Client: That'd be fine.
Therapist: Okay. The muscle weakness with this drug is very rare, uh, usually doesn't even happen, okay? Uh, if it happens it usually happens within the first month of taking the medicine, you'll notice it in terms of weakness in the arms, uh, or some muscle pain, it's not usual. If this should happen, uh, if you let the doctor or me know right away, we can get you off the medicine, it's completely reversible. It's, the muscle weakness will go away within a couple of days, right.
Client: Oh.
Therapist: Now, you don't wanna let that go on for months at a time, that's when it can become serious.
Client: Okay.
Therapist: But otherwise, again it's rare, and it's completely reversible if you let us know.
Client: Well, I guess it doesn't worry me quite as much if it's reversible like that. You know, I was thinking this was gonna be a big-time, but, uh, uh, yeah, I guess, it sounds manageable.
Therapist: Okay, and, uh, so talk to me a little bit more about what the doctors told you about-about your risks of stroke or heart attack while you're ta- while you have high cholesterol.
Client: Oh, he just said that the risks are-are up, I think he called it elevated but, uh, you know, uh, that I'm at a higher risk of having a stroke or a heart attack down the line, uh, you know, that's down the line.
Therapist: Okay, well how important would it be for you to-to, uh, do whatever you can to reduce your risks of stroke or heart attack down the line?
Client: Well, you know, my wife and I wanna retire in about four to five years and we wanna be really active visiting all sorts of places, The Fjords, Norway, things like that so I-I guess having a stroke or a heart attack would really be bad for that so and, you know, we-we-we wanna live our dreams actively.
Therapist: Yeah, and-and one of the- certainly one of the risks of stroke is paralysis, and if you wanna be active that could be-
Client: Whoa.
Therapist: -really a problem.

Client: Thank you.
Therapist: I'd say my name is Mark and I work here at Green Prescriptions. And-
Client: Mm-hmm.
Therapist: I know a little bit about you from the referral letter from the doctor.
Client: From my GP?
Therapist: From your GP, yeah.
Client: Uh.
Therapist: But before we get to anything, I'll probably want to just ask you a little bit about what's led you to come here today and get a bit of an idea about what's been going on for you.
Client: What's led me to come here?
Therapist: Mm.
Client: My GP.
Therapist: And what did he have to say?
Client: Well, um, you know, I had my sort of, uh, checkup.
Therapist: mm.
Client: And it revealed that apparently, I might have diabetes 2. Well, that's what he says.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Um, I-I think that I feel perfectly well. I-I'm, you know-- I understand people with diabetes are a little bit plumper than I am.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: But, um, that's really why I'm here. I'm on his command, almost.
Therapist: Right, so he kinda gave you a directive?
Client: Well, he did. He says he's going to put me on some sort of program if it gets worse.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: But as I say, I-I feel absolutely fine now.
Therapist: So it kind of came a bit of a surprise, you feeling okay.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: You go for this checkup with the doctor. And he says, ""You've got Type II diabetes.""
Client: Mm, I'm very surprised.
Therapist: Mm. Came out of the blue for you?
Client: Yes. I think it did.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Mm.
Therapist: And you said you kind of don't fit that kinda Type II diabetes look. That you kinda have had this idea-
Client: I-
Therapist: -you've been-been overweight with it.
Client: That's what I understand.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: You know, and I'm not overweight.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I-I sort of look after myself to a limited extent in that way. Um, but I'm a busy person, I suppose I burn off the calories. And-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I don't know, really.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: My lifestyle—
Therapist: Hmm. So it doesn't quite fit in your head, Type II diabetes and-
Client: No.
Therapist: -your lifestyle?
Client: No, not at all.
Therapist: Comes as a big surprise. And what was your reaction when he told you that at the time?
Client: Well, I-I thought he must be joking. To be honest. I thought-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -you know, why you are-- Look around you.
Therapist: Mm, mm.
Client: um, I just felt that, um-- I mean, I don't think he was wasting my time because why would he do that?
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: Right?
Therapist: He's got a lot to do.
Client: Um-- Absolutely right.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: He's got a job to do. And obviously, the tests have come through. And I have got these signs of diabetes 2.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Right? Um, I just think that-- Well, I just don't feel like it, Mark.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Um—
Therapist: So how are you feel in your head-
Client: I feel absolutely fine.
Therapist: -and what the tests say kind of like don't join up.
Client: Yeah. Well, physically, I feel absolutely fine.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I'm-I'm-- I didn't see anything wrong with me at all.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: I mean, I get around, I sleep pretty well-
Therapist: Hmm-hmm.
Client: I sort of you know-
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: - I'm-I'm compos mentis. So I don't—
Therapist: Yeah. What's the problem? Mm.
Client: What is the problem?
Therapist: And how did this happen is probably kind of what you're also thinking. Well, how did this--?
Client: Well, uh, yes. I mean-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -I must admit, I haven't done too much research. I've been a bit busy.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Um, but he-he was saying something about, I don't know, family or whatever. I don't know.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And I don't know if it's hereditary.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: I think he said something about it being hereditary.
Therapist: So he mentioned, it might be a family thing. And so you-
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: -maybe got from your parents or something of the sort.
Client: Yeah, it could be-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -because, um, my mother mentioned-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -that, uh, my father had diabetes-
Therapist: Right.
Client: -diabetes 2. And if I think about it, um, his brother-
Therapist: Mm-hmm.
Client: -uh, I haven't seen him for years.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But he might well have it because he is-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -a pretty cuddly guy. You know-
Therapist: Right.
Client: He's pretty big.
Therapist: So he fits the picture-
Client: Well, yes, the stereotype,-
Therapist: -when you think about what he-he-- Yeah, he's stereotypical.
Client: Yeah, I guess.
Therapist: A little bit bigger, perhaps doesn't look after himself that well, and he fits that foot
Client: Well, yeah. I mean, as far as I know, I hadn't seen him for-
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -I don't know how many years.
Therapist: Mm. So you got this knowledge as a witness there's some family history of diabetes in the past?
Client: Apparently so. Yes, apparently so.
Therapist: Doctor mentioned that as being a factor.
Client: Mm, I mean, it is hereditary, is it?
Therapist: That's certainly true. Yes. We know that people who've had parents or have been in the past, there is a hereditary factor or genetic factor in-involved.
Client: A genetic factor. And so, does that mean that if you've got, um, if you've got a history of this within your family-
Therapist: Mm.
Client: -if it's a gene-- you are more likely than not to get it?
Therapist: Correct. Yeah.
Client: Also, it's—
Therapist: But it's not inevitable.
Client: Right. Okay.
Therapist: Because its genes or the-the-the-the hereditary factor is not the only factor that causes it or is involved in it happening to you. So there's other factors that come into play.
Client: I'm sure you're going to tell me what they are.
Therapist: Well, you've-you've mentioned some of the things you know, and one of those is hereditary factors. You mentioned that the doctor mentioned that. And what else do you know or have you heard? You say you haven't had a lot of time to do the research. What else? Other things you've.
Client: To be frank, Mark, I honestly don't know. I mean, I honestly don't know what causes it because I've never had any reason. It came upon me from the GP and it took me back.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, the hereditary thing I thought, well, maybe that's the explanation.
Therapist: That makes a bit of sense.
Client: And why go any further, it's there?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Can't help it.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: They live pretty long lives, they did, all right.
Therapist: They managed with it.
Client: Relatives relatively went into their 70s.
Therapist: Okay. I don't know if it'd be helpful for you if you'd like to know a little bit more about some of the factors involved in time Type II diabetes.
Client: Well.
Therapist: If that would help.
Client: If there's something that you think that-- Yes. Yes, of course.
Therapist: Well, I'll perhaps share with you what I know from working with other people and some of the things I've experienced in working with people.
Client: Okay.
Therapist: And see what you make of it. See if it fits a little bit more with where you're at. We know that there is a strong family factor or hereditary factor, so that's one aspect. So also it tends to happen a little bit later in life, rather than something you might get when you're a teenager, this type of diabetes. So-so it's a later onset. It takes a bit of time for it to develop maybe. And the main reason I think, um, the main aspect of it is that it, have you heard about insulin.
Client: I've heard of it yeah.
Therapist: So that's a hormone or a chemical, it allows you to utilize sugar in your body.
Client: Right.
Therapist: All right. And Type II diabetes typically people have a resistance or a resistance to insulin in their cells, in their fat cells or their muscle cells or liver cells. They can't use insulin. And so sugar builds up in your system.
Client: Are you saying that they-they like they can't digest insulin or is that?
Therapist: You need insulin in your cells, individual cells in muscle or in fat or wherever to, um, use up excess sugar or to utilize sugar.
Client: Oh, I see. So-so it's like a-it's like a balance.
Therapist: That's right.
Client: So insulin you-you.
Therapist: Kind of, as your.
Client: You have yourself draws bar.
Therapist: Yap.
Client: Or something, and then what balances that out in the body is the insulin taking off the excess.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Or-or digesting? Should I say the excessive sugars?
Therapist: That's a good way to think.
Client: Is that what happened?
Therapist: Exactly. And what's happening in Type II diabetes is your-your fat cells and liver cells and muscle cells are resistant to insulin. It's almost like they're saying we can't use that.
Client: Why?
Therapist: And if-- Well, there's a number of-- We're not entirely sure, there's a lot of research still going on as to how this happens and how that could be modified. But what we do know is that, um, one of the key things in managing it is to try and modify or modulate, control the amount of sugar that are in your system.
Client: Right. Okay.
Therapist: Yeah. So there's a couple of things that we know that people with Type II diabetes have to look after and have to think about if they want to control the amount of sugar that's in their system, which is the main issue that's causing some of the health problems that people have with Type II diabetes. Too much sugar, and if it's not able to be utilized in the blood cell, in the fat cells, or liver cells, and the muscle cells stays in your bloodstream. And that can cause problems with your circulation. So too high blood sugar and too low a blood sugar can be a problem. So sugar is the main concern in Type II- Type II diabetes.And you mentioned earlier on, a couple of things that the doctor-- You've mentioned some signs that he was kind of a little bit concerned about. Well, what things did you notice over the-over the last month or so?
Client: You mean, personally?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Well, I didn't know. I mean, the thing is you see that-- I mean, I did think about this a little bit and I thought, well, over time, if things happen slowly, you don't really notice.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: As you get older.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I don't-I don't leap over five bar gates like I used to, you know, um, as opposed to, uh, running with the backs now, I tend to spend more time, you know, with my old mates in the bar.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: At the rugby club and-and-and the such like, yeah. And, um, the fish I'm hooking, I'm not after the kings anymore, I go for the snapper now, it's a bit easier, you know.
Therapist: A slightly more sedate lifestyle.
Client: Yeah, absolutely. You just do.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: You just do. Um, so you're less demanding, I guess, on your-on your body, you realize, and you don't really want to do these things anyway. You know, you let the youngsters get home.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Been there, done that. So you don't really notice. So I'm coming back to this diagnosis I had from my GP and him saying, ""You've got diabetes 2,"" well, I should feel like that, shouldn't I?
Therapist: Yeah. It should feel like there's something really wrong with you.
Client: Yeah, I mean.
Therapist: What's-how have you been feeling over the last month? So, you say you're very busy you're doing a lot of work.
Client: Yeah, I mean I'm a busy person. All right? I uh, my work uh, I work in insurance, so I'm always hopping from one place to another place.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, I haven't noticed.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: I really haven't noticed how, um, okay I get a bit--I suppose I get a bit out of breath sometimes.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: If I rush too much that-that's true. Um, I suppose, um, I don't go upstairs two at a time anymore, I use one at a time.
Therapist: So a little bit sort of energy is not quite there sometimes? The vitality.
Client: Oh, certainly the energy I have is-is not what I-what I had. I mean I do need to, you know, I'm busy but I do need to sit down, um, uh, I do need to sit down and relax with a cup of coffee, you know, and, uh, things.
Therapist: Yeah, Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, more than I would normally.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: But that would be, that would be about it.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, is it getting worse? I don't know. I-I-I suppose. What worse? Is it-is it increasing? Well, to say, I don't really notice it.
Therapist: You haven't noticed it. So it's a progressive, you know, you've just seen this, as-as you got older, things have slowed down. You know those activities you used to do, but that's kind of like what happens.
Client: Yeah, yeah. Um, at least, that's what I think. I mean I don't know if you're telling me that I should be more active or my GP is saying I should be more active.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, as I say, uh, you know I-I don't do any regular form of exercise, I have to say, not anymore.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: But maybe I-maybe I don't know.
Therapist: Hmm, a bit of a mystery there.
Client: I mean I've got uh, well I-I mean I've got a great lifestyle. I mean if it's very-it-it's very good. I mean I've got all my mates in down at the rugby club. And I've got uh, you know even in the summer when that's a bit damn. I used to coach rugby and I coached cricket when I finished playing. So-so I've got the-the guys in the cricket club, um, you know, for the-for the, uh, for the summer evenings. And, uh, and then, uh, the-then, of course, we've got the fishing, and that's all of us combined. We're a big gang, really.
Therapist: Really? So what I'm hearing is there's actually a lot of aspects in your life which are really good.
Client: Oh, I think my life yeah. My life is great.
Therapist: From your perspective, things are going well?
Client: My life is great, and then you turn around and say, ""Hey you've got-- you-you're ill, you're sick.
Therapist: Yeah. It doesn't fit.
Client: And um, no I'm not. But you see, he said to me that he's gonna put me on some sort of, uh, a daily monitoring of, is it sugar levels?
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: And I'm gonna have to take regular pills.
Therapist: Right.
Client: Well frankly, the only pills I take are sort of paracetamols.
Therapist: Yeah. When you get uh, a headache.
Client: For a bit of the head in the morning, you know.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um.
Therapist: So the idea of having to test-test your blood sugar and take medications is kinda like off--
Client: Come on, you know.
Therapist: And you know that's a bit too-
Client: Well, life is too short.
Therapist: Too much.
Client: You know it's the truth.
Therapist: Yeah. Okay.
Client: I mean you know—
Therapist: And you're here today and that's probably something in you you've thought well I'll follow this through, you know I'll-I'll come along and see what-see what they've got to say. And I'm just wondering for this session, for the time we have today, there's a number of things we could talk about. You mentioned a couple of things about your lifestyle and, um, medication is one thing you've been told by the doctor you might need to do that. And a number of things that we could talk about today. Which-which area would you think would be useful for you to focus on?
Client: Well there is-there is something that you sort of prompted me to think about, and, um, I split up-- My wife and I, we split up several years ago now. And, um, you know we've been married for many many years.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: And um, I think she used to look after me because she used to do the cooking and-and-and stuff like that.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: And I have to say that I'm not the best cook in the world.
Therapist: Mh-hmm.
Client: Um, and-and being on the run all the time and you know once I get back home, it's, you know, it's time to go down to the rugby club or whatever it might be, uh, we're out with the mates. And, uh, I-I do I suppose my food is not as healthy perhaps as it used to be when she was around. She's moved down to Hamilton to live with her mother, if you've met her mother. Anyway, but, um.
Therapist: So then, since you've been on your own since you've separated, divorced and you've noticed that the things you eat and how you eat has changed.
Client: Yeah, I mean mates and their wives are pretty cool about it sometimes.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Because, you know, they'll invite me for dinner and so on.
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
Client: And, yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess, you know, that's when you, well, or whatever reason, you split up in life.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You start looking at the home life of somebody else, you're thinking, ""Hmm, I use d to have this.""
Therapist: Hmm. Yeah, yeah.
Client: And you think, "" This is nice food, "" isn't it? and you know.
Therapist: Yeah. And your-- part of your wife used to do a lot of that for you?
Client: Oh, she would do all the cooking. Yeah, yeah,
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: I mean, I never bothered to boil an egg in the water, you know.
Therapist: And so she would kinda look after what you ate and healthy things that you had, spread in front of you and off you go.
Client: Totally. I mean, I was just in charge of the wine, you know.
Therapist: Mm-hmm. And now you have to think about what you might eat and sometimes you don't eat the best.
Client: Well I-- This is what I'm saying. Maybe I'm not thinking about it. Maybe that's the thing.
Therapist: Okay.
Client: Maybe I'm just—
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You know, because it-- you know this-- the pizza shop's just on the road.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And then there's-- I mean, okay, I confess that lunchtime, occasionally, it's uh, I'm hungry and McDonald's is very convenient
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -or Kentucky Fried or whatever.
Therapist: Very appealing, isn't it?
Client: You know, it's very easy. and then, um, then you think to yourself, well-- I mean, I do think of myself that maybe I should have a few vegetables around here or whatever. But then you go out into the supermarkets, you know, and you can pick up, uh, your- one of your TV dinners.
Therapist: Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm.
Client: So you bring those in and you open them up and put them in the microwave and there's vegetables there.
Therapist: Yeah they look pretty good on the plate, don't they?
Client: Yeah, it looks- it looks fine, you know, et cetera. I mean, so that will happen occasionally if I've got a night in. But cooking-wise, no, I haven't cooked anything, um, other than boil the water for the kettle for a cup o coffee.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -for ages.
Therapist: They're food choices in what you eat and what's in your diet it's not what-something you actually you've actually been aware of or had to think about in the past.
Client: Yeah. I do miss her breakfast. I have to say, we used to have get a nice breakfast.
Therapist: So one thing that you noticed is diet and the eating patterns and-
Client: Well—
Therapist: -when you eat. That's one aspect. What other aspects do you think you've-- you would be--?
Client: Well, I used to be quite a heavy smoker, right? I mean, I'd smoke a pack in a half a day. And I knew that wasn't doing me any good.
Therapist: Right.
Client: I mean the thing is when you're a-- I mean, I've always smoked. So, but when you're young and you're a sportsman, you know—
Therapist: You kinda juggle those two things and kinda--
Client: Well, the two things they balance out, you know and everybody else is
Therapist: You still run and have a cigarette?
Client: You know, you pass a cigarette down the backline almost, don't you? You know, just before the game gets—
Therapist: Hmm. Hmm. Yeah, part of the culture.
Client: Yeah, part of the of the whole thing. And it's changed a bit now, because in my day when we were playing, of course, it was a very much more of a social game, which was spent-spent in the rugby club.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: That's why you played and it was a big buddy-buddy thing.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: That was rugby and cricket was the same really.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Um, but now—
Therapist: But over the years, you've actually reduced your smoking or you've stopped altogether or at times?
Client: Well I-I, yeah. I was getting a bit sort of-- I was getting a bit, you know, a bit wheezy and I thought, ""I'll cut this out.""
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: But I enjoy smoking. I really do enjoy it. So I cut it down to I suppose it's about 10 a day now.
Therapist: Okay, so you meant to reduce.
Client: Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: You were noticing that it's having an impact on your breathing and health wasn't so good.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: When you related that to your smoking, so you managed to reduce your smoking.
Client: Yeah, yeah. I sort of—
Therapist: So you've made our decision to do that?
Client: it-it-it's-- you know, she will, ""Why don't you give up? You've gone so far, why don't you just stop?"" But I don't want to.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: It's-it's-- I-I enjoy it, um—
Therapist: Yeah, and it's hard to get to stop something you enjoy, isn't it?
Client: Well, yeah. I mean, you know, the thing is that you get to, you know, you've got to-- when you get down to that, you, uh, you have to regulate sort of-
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: You know, you have to be quite strong-willed about, I suppose, in a way.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: So you say, ""Okay, well, you don't have a cigarette unless you have a cup of coffee. [laughs]
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: Of course, that's a double-edged sword a bit, because then I found I was drinking more coffee, you know.
Therapist: But they go together so well. And sugar in the coffee?
Client: Oh, yeah, yeah. I have two sugars. A couple of sugar in coffee. Yeah, yeah.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: So we cut that down as I say.
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: But the problem goes that coffee, we're up to 8 or so, 10 cups of coffee a day now.
Therapist: You're drinking more coffee. So what I've heard you say so far is, if I can just start right back from the beginning and you used to come in and sais, ""I went to the doctor."" You went for-- it sounds like you went for just a checkup.
Client: No, you know, there's a friend of mine, one of the guys down the rugby club, he said- he said, ""I'm going for my annual, you know-
Therapist: MIT.
Client: -warranty of fitness, sort of thing, you know. And I thought, now that's an idea, not been to one of those.
Therapist: Got to check out, why not?
Client: So I'm 55, and you read in the papers, you know, it's that at 55 you will-- you know, heart disease is more prevalent
Therapist: Hmm.
Client: -and all these sorts of things that you get around this middle-age time. So I thought, ""Well, I'll go and have one."" And frankly, when I went along, I was very confident. I thought, you know, the doctor is going to saying, ""Hmm, I wish I was as healthy as you,"" sort of thing.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Um, but unfortunately, uh, he-he came up with this. And it's the only thing I think he really came up with. I think-
Therapist: So everything else looked pretty good?
Client: My cholesterol is quite good, not too bad.
Therapist: Cholesterol good, your weight is good.
Client: Yeah-yeah. Not too bad.
Therapist: Um, you are smoking, but you've managed to reduce that.
Client: Well, yeah, I've cut it down, yeah. I mean, that's been three years, mind.
Therapist: And anything else, you know, you go ticking down the list. The tire is good, oil good.
Client: Absolutely.
Therapist: So we're looking good.
Client: And then we come to this-
Therapist: And ah, hang on.
Client: -too much sugar in the tank, or something. I don't know.
Therapist: Yeah, there's something wrong with the, uh, with this bit.
Client: So, yeah.
Therapist: And it doesn't quite fit with how you see your own lifestyle.
Client: No.
Therapist: Because you've-- it sounds like what you've been doing, you've made some conscious effort to be aware of some of those things you might think are important.
Client: I mean, yeah. I mean, you know, the thing is, you see, the thing is, and I mean, and probably you've-- I think you've heard this before, but people, they turn around, oh, uh, you know, doom and gloom prophets, you shouldn't drink.
Therapist: Mm.
Client: You shouldn't smoke.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: And then I think to myself, ""Well, maybe I shouldn't socialize."" And then after that, ""Well, maybe I shouldn't be alive.""
Therapist: So like a domino effect, and they'll all be just sitting-
Client: You know. I mean, what-what-what's going on here? This is- this is- this is so many people's lives.
Therapist: Mm-hm.
Client: And um, I suppose, you know, if it came down to it, then, and somebody said, ""Well, you can solve this problem by taking a pill once a day, um, you know, it will keep it down, and there will be no problems,"" Then I-I could go with that. But what I don't want to do, um, the doctor was saying, or insinuating, that I'd have to change my lifestyle.
Therapist: A bit broad kind of like you've gotta change everything.
Client: Yeah. It was um, and I-I said, well, no. I'm sorry. [coughs] I'm not going to change my lifestyle. I've got to where I am. I'm reasonably happy. Okay, I wish I wasn't separated. Okay, I wish my kids were-were still around, um, you know. One of them is off now in, um, in-- back in Europe playing rugby in France.
Therapist: Yeah. And your thought was, yeah, right, I hear that, but actually, I don't want to make all these big changes in my life.
Client: No, I don't want to, because I don't feel that I need to.
Therapist: Feel like you need to. Yeah.
Client: I mean, it's you know, why?
Therapist: Mm.
Client: Um, I can't argue with a medical professional, Mark, because I know nothing, you know.
Therapist: The test, is the test, and experience, yeah.
Client: So, I mean, what-what-what-what suggestions would you have? I mean, what-what sort of-
Therapist: I don't know. I think it's up to you where we start, and that's the question I've got in my mind. You've mentioned a couple of things that you've already made some effort, or been conscious of. You've mentioned the diet, you've mentioned your smoking, those are two quite important aspects that we often talk about here in how people work.
Client: Is smoking related to diabetes then?
Therapist: It can have an impact, yes. So smoking, um, affects your blood system, so it hardens the arteries, um, and over time, it can have a significant impact on the healing of wounds. So people with Type II diabetes, often, if they get a cut, or a bruise, or something, it takes a long time to heal. Smoking reduces the amount of oxygen in your system, so that can further, you know, limit the time it takes your body to heal.
Client: Oh.
Therapist: So we know that smoking and Type II diabetes together-
Client: Don't help.
Therapist: -isn't a good combination.
Client: Is it okay if you have one without the other? I'm sorry, it's a silly question. [laughs]
Therapist: Well, the question is, I suppose, that I have for you is, where would you think, for you, would be a good place to start? If you were gonna make any changes, even small changes at the beginning, rather than just thinking, oh, I got to change everything, which it sounds like you're not prepared to, you know, do a whole lifestyle change, and I don't think that's what we're talking about here. Where would you feel most comfortable to start if you were gonna make any changes at all?
Client: Where would I start? Well, I-- What if about if I cut down on sugar in the coffee? If we could have long blacks, no milk, and no sugar.
Therapist: Yeah. Hmm, that might be a start.
Client: I think I could- I think I could probably handle that.
Therapist: Hm. What we also find is that people make these little changes, small changes, and that starts to kind of well, it makes them-
Client: Something of a rollover effect.
Therapist: -rollover, the domino effect starts to happen, and they start looking at other aspects.
Client: Domino effect, yeah.
Therapist: So rather than thinking, ""oh, my God, I have to change all these things. I've gotta stop smoking, I've gotta exercise more, I've gotta, you know, start eating more fruit and vegetables,"" you might start with these small changes, and then-
Client: I mean, how much exercise should I do a week?
Therapist: Um, I-I'm reluctant to give a prescription for that because I think it's really up to you. And I think it depends on how things go, as to how much you need to do.
Client: Right.
Therapist: You mentioned earlier on, the doctors talking about you monitoring your blood sugar.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: So on how-- It depends on how-how that goes. Let's say, if you started doing that and you do some more exercise, you start to have longer blacks, rather than short blacks with lots of sugar. And you get down the sugar and you find your blood sugar starts to come down, then we're heading in the right direction.
Client: Okay, so—
Therapist: So it's really, I suppose, up to how things go for you, and you get that feedback. And if that's going in the right direction, you carry on doing and do some more of that.
Client: So, a-are we saying then that-that, really all I need to do, for this moment, is I can forget about everything, but cut out the sugar, uh, in the coffee and the milk-- I don't know, but you might as well, you know, milk without sugar is silly. But, um, if we do that, is that where we start?
Therapist: I think where we start is where you feel comfortable starting.
Client: Well, I mean that's something that's not difficult to do.
Therapist: Apples for breakfast.
Client: You start off at breakfast and get yourself an apple, a bit-a bit of apple and-and so on. Um—
Therapist: So what I'm hearing you're kind of saying is, that there's-- You're now starting to think of some very useful little starting points.
Client: Maybe.
Therapist: Not huge changes, but some little things you could do.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And it's kind of dawning on you there may be some possibilities here for making some changes. Let me ask you this. Um, let's say you put some of these things in place and you start to make some of these small changes.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: Um, where do you see that taking you in the next set of three, four, five years? You know, where do you want to be in three to four years' time? What would be your ideal picture?
Client: Well, you know, and this is difficult because I don't feel unhealthy now.
Therapist: No.
Client: So, I suppose it would be fun to-- Maybe I should join a club or two, that's what I'm thinking because I'll be with mates.
Therapist: Yeah? You like the social aspect?
Client: I love the social aspect of it, and, um, there's-there's-- I know there's a bar in this club as well. I-- Don't-don't misunderstand me, I don't drink-
Therapist: No, no, I get that. I get that.
Client: -till-- You know, I'm not an alcoholic or anything like that, I—
Therapist: So part of that whole keeping fit and exercise stuff is actually the social side of it, isn't it?
Client: So yeah, so to get that balance, and maybe that's what I'm actually missing in life, and maybe this is, um-- I mean yes I do get up in the morning sometimes, and I suppose I do feel a bit—
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: You know? Even after a decent night's sleep, you know?
Therapist: Haven't quite that-
Client: And you need-- I'm getting this cup of coffee and maybe I'm—
Therapist: And the coffee helps a little bit because it perks you up?
Client: And that gets me going. Yeah.
Therapist: And the sugar in it helps too.
Client: Yeah, the sugar gives me the boost, I suppose. I-it's fantastic.
Therapist: So what I'm hearing is that your life, your work, your routines are-- Sometimes you're driving or you've got to keep awake, get up in the morning sometimes and you haven't quite got that buzz or the energy. You need a shot, and then throughout the day you might need just more shots to keep that energy up.
Client: Hmm. If I give up sugar in my coffee, give up the milk, black coffees, right?
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: if I find some social form of exercise, like squash.
Therapist: And an activity which has got a starting to finish and it's something you do for a slot.
Client: Yeah.
Therapist: And then there's maybe some social aspects to it as well.
Client: Yeah, and then—
Therapist: You can see some benefits and some enjoyment that.
Client: And then, you know, give this, say, six months, I don't know what period it would be, then go back to the GP and say, ""Test me again.""
Therapist: That sounds like a great plan.
Client: And so maybe that would, uh—
Therapist: Yeah, sounds like a good idea.
Client: Maybe it's an idea. I mean—
Therapist: I think anything you do, it has to be something you've decided. You know, just start where you want to start. You've mentioned some really good ideas about possibly getting a little bit more exercise into your life, doing something like squash or something of that nature. You've mentioned some really good ideas about reducing the amount of sugar you-you-you're-you're intaking during the day, and coffee is a good place to start. Having an apple for breakfast, I think you mentioned that, a bit of fruit.
Client: Yeah, like my wife used to. Yeah.
Therapist: Those are some really good ideas and good starting points. So thinking about it like that, what-- Where are you now? What's your-- What-what-- Where-where is your thinking now?
Client: Well, you see, I mean, I'm thinking, ""Actually it might not be a bad idea this,"" because [chuckles] it would mean I could socialize harder, couldn't I? No, no I'm just joking. Uh, but, um, yeah, I mean, why not? Why not? Why not? It might be fun, it's a new path.
Therapist: What's to lose? What's to gain?
Client: Well, it would appear that there is something to gain, and-- I mean, I-- What do I lose? I don't know until I do it. But I'm thinking that if I do it and I do what I'm enjoying doing, I won't miss what I'm not doing. Does that make sense?
Therapist: It does make sense, yeah.
Client: Um, yeah I don't mind. I-- It's not a—
Therapist: So when you look at it, there's probably more to gain from making these changes than there is to lose.
Client: I'll talk to Billy about, um-- Billy is, um, he's the gym bloke.
Therapist: Right.
Client: I'll have a word with him because I'm due down the club tonight.
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: Really.
Therapist: So you've got to work these things on your mind. You know, the-- And workout where's the place to start.
Client: Yeah, I think that you say where-where you're at now, where you're going, where—
Therapist: Yeah.
Client: -and-and-and this is what I've got to do. I think I'm in a rut. I think that's where I've—
Therapist: You've been stuck?
Client: I'm-I'm just-- I'm-I'm satisfiedly sort of contented, uh, sitting in this- in this rut and, um, that my doctor has actually di-diagnosed me with diabetes 2-
Therapist: Yeah?
Client: -which he says can be managed, and you seem to be insinuating that it can be managed.
Therapist: Indeed, yeah.
Client: Uh, maybe this is a blessing, actually-
Therapist: So rather than--
Client: -because I think to myself, ""Well, if someday, I am diagnosed with diabetes, I'd just carry on and-""
Therapist: Carrying on.
Client: ""-sitting in the corner of the bar, and chat, and talk and probably get fat."" I don't know, and make it worse. And, yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe.
Therapist: So it's been a bit of a-a bit of a shock, but now you kinda reflect on it.
Client: Yeah, that's cool.
Therapist: Maybe this is the-
